He is remembered through decades of releases across film and television genres, starting all the way back in 1977. Hurt was nominated for his first-ever film role, in 1980’s Altered State, which launched his career to incredible heights.</p><p data-characters=620 data-current-count=986 data-injectable=true>The next decade saw Hurt star in a swathe of award-winning films, including 1985’s heavily-awarded Kiss of the Spider Woman. Hurt won a full seven awards for Kiss of the Spider Woman, including the BAFTA for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the London Film Critics Circle Award for Actor of the Year. Hurt went on to enjoy a thoroughly decorated career, appearing in films and television series that ticked off nearly every entertainment genre in the book. He even appeared in several Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, starting with 2008’s The Incredible Hulk and concluding with 2021’s Black Widow.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Long before he played Thaddeus Ross in the MCU, Hurt was dazzling audiences with his numerous other roles. He hardly slowed down over the course of his career — even following his cancer diagnosis — and leaves behind a robust legacy. He also leaves behind considerable wealth, which the 71-year-old actor accumulated over years of Hollywood releases.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>William Hurt’s net worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/William_Hurt_Lost_in_Space.jpg><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>At the time of his death, Hurt had amassed an enviable income, but not nearly so much wealth as one might expect. This could be due to Hurt’s scattered success in love, which saw him endure two failed marriages between the late 1970s and early 1990s, or perhaps simply due to the actor’s health issues and age at the time of his death.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>Regardless of the reason behind it, Hurt accumulated a net worth of around $8 million over the course of his career, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">List</a>. While this number doesn’t reach nearly the heights of some of Hollywood’s most popular regulars, like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Denzel Washington</a>, it is still enviable to most.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>Hurt leaves his fortune, and his home just outside of Paris, to his four children. He shares one child with dancer Sandra Jennings, two with artist and choreographer Heidi Henderson, and one with French actress and director Sandrine Bonnaire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGLEor%2BMsKClpJmWum601KurrGWemsFuw86rq6Flp52yr3nHnmSpmaOosqV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chain-breaker-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zach Williams Chain Breaker lyric</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shawna-trpcic-emmy-nominated-costume-designer-for-star-wars-series-the-mandalorian-dies-at-56.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shawna Trpcic, Emmy-nominated costume designer for Star Wars series The Mandalorian, dies at 56</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
