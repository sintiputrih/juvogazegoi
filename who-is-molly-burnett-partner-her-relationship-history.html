Her Instagram (<a href=#>@mollyburnett</a>) handle is mostly full of posts related to her job and career. That makes it tough for us to know if Molly had any partners in 2022.</p><p>That being said, Molly shared a picture of herself with the Queen of the South actor Hemky Madera and called him her “partner in crime.” However, it seems like there’s nothing going on between too as Hemky is happily in a relationship with his partner, Jesse Lynn Madera.</p><p>While Molly may not talk about her personal life on the Internet, she has talked about dating previously. In an exclusive video interview with Golderby in 2018, she shared that she’s never done the dating app thing.

His wife, Chelsea Hill, is a fitness professional and a BODI instructor. The lovely couple is also the parents of two beautiful human beings, Scarlett and Wyatt.</p><p>After splitting up with Aaron, Molly moved on to a comparatively more public romance as she began dating her onscreen boyfriend from Days of Our Lives Casey Jon Deidrick. Much like her previous relationship, her romance with Casey also lasted one year as they broke up in 2010.</p><p>In 2021, Molly’s former boyfriend Casey Deidrick was dating his longtime girlfriend Jahan Yousaf, whom he began dating in 2013.</p><p>To sum up Molly’s relationship history, Law & Order: SUV actress has only been linked to two men in the past 14 years.</p><h3><strong>Molly Burnett Movies And TV Shows</strong></h3><p>Molly Burnett was known to have a dramatic flair about her from a young age.
