When <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trains were invented</a> people thought their hearts would explode from the speed and vibration. When wireless Wi-Fi was invented people assumed it would <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make them sick</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>People are now claiming now that Danish actor <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mads Mikkelsen</a></strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would make a way better Witcher</a> than announced replacement Chris Hemsworth. At first glance; what? The more you think about it, though, the more it makes sense. Mikkelsen brings a range and a depth to literally every role, so why not?</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Let’s take a look at five Mads Mikkelsen performances that prove he’s worthy of getting a coin tossed to him.</p><h2 id=h-fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore data-injectable=false>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Back in 2020, Mikkelsen replaced a scandal-plagued Johnny Depp as Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Mikkelsen’s performance in Fantastic Beasts: The Secret of Dumbledore was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">widely praised</a> as the best thing in the Harry Potter spin-off. Mikkelsen plays an incredibly powerful wizard with a complicated storyline that shows not only evil and rage, but tenderness underneath.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Fantastic Beasts: The Secret of Dumbledore proves that Mikkelsen can handle supernatural themes and storylines while still presenting a nuanced character. Part of the fun of Geralt in The Witcher is that while he’s inherently good, he’s also a murderer who kills things for money.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>Mikkelsen would be able to pull out the more subtle parts of a Geralt performance, something Henry Cavill did very well in the role.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Doctor Strange</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>In 2016’s Doctor Strange, Mikkelsen plays a character named Kaecilius, a sorcerer who also knows kung fu. The role demonstrates Mikkelsen’s ability to play a character that’s physical and an ass-kicker. Mikkelsen does play villians frequently, but this one is squarely in an action franchise wheelhouse.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>Mikkelson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EW</a> that playing the character was a “dream… it’s flying kung fu! I didn’t hesitate…. it’s a childhood dream. Bruce Lee was my biggest hero and still is. At the age of 50, you get to do stuff that you probably should have done when you were 15. But hey, who am I to say no?”</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>This is a role that proves Mikkelsen could handle the necessary physicality for the part of Geralt. And presence? Mikkelsen has buckets of it.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chaos Walking</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>Chaos Walking was a box office bomb, but once again Mikkelsen delivers a layered performance as mayor David Prentiss, a man with a dark secret.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Mikkelsen once again demonstrates his range in the movie. He somehow manages to appear kind and terrifying all at the same time, and provides another example of how much gravitas he would bring to the role of Geralt of Rivea.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>We also get to see Mikkelsen on a horse and he looks great doing it! That’s one less thing he has to learn how to do, or would, if he somehow ended up in The Witcher.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Rogue One</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>In Rogue One, Mikkelsen plays Galen Erso, the man responsible for creating the flaw in the design of the Death Star that was ultimately used to bring it down.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Erso is a complicated character. He’s a part of the Empire, but fled and ended up witnessing his wife’s murder at its hands. He was forced to complete his work and eventually died in his daughter’s arms after passing along the secret to defeating the Death Star.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>What’s great about this role is the duplicity required. He had to pretend to be working for the Empire all while trying to sabotage the Empire. The scenes where he has to witness his wife’s death are also heartbreaking. There’s no doubt that Mikkelsen could use these skills as Geralt.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Clash of the Titans</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>Clash of the Titans from 2010 is probably the most concrete example of what Mikkelsen as Geralt would look like. His hair is braided, he’s wearing medieval armor, and he’s a menace with a sword; all skills that would be necessary for The Witcher.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>His natural ease with a sword and innate charisma shine through brightly in this film. He also tones down the ‘quiet and evil but compassionate’ act that he uses so often for something more valiant and hero-like. It also shows that he knows how to have a little fun in a role, and allows that to translate on screen.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>The more you think about it the more it becomes clear: let’s lose Chris Hemsworth and get Mads Mikkelsen in The Witcher. While it’s a longshot, it’s also Hollywood, where pretty much anything is possible.</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e5RmpJqco2K6qrfKnqOsnZ5ivaa%2BxaipppmemLK0edOhmK1loKe8t7GMoZydZZ2WuKZ5wGannqqWmrC1edaiq5yglad8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-conrad-net-worth-262523.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Conrad Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steph-curry-son-milestone-haircut-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steph Curry's son reaches major milestone - see adorable photo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
