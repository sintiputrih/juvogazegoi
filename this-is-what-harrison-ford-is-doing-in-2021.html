Disney executives also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that this installment would be the last Indiana Jones film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, a then 71-year-old Ford had expressed his interest in returning to the franchise, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stating </a>"To me, what was interesting about the character was that he prevailed, that he had courage, that he had wit, that he had intelligence, that he was frightened and he still managed to survive. That I can do."</p><p>Filming on the Untitled Indiana Jones Project began in June 2021. Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been cast</a> alongside Ford, and John Williams is returning to compose the film's score.

Ford was photographed attending a play <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">featuring Lily Allen</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grabbing takeout pizza </a>in Mayfair, a London neighborhood.</p><h2 id=harrison-ford-has-been-getting-in-shape><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Harrison Ford Has Been Getting In Shape</span></h2><p>He may be 79 years old, but Harrison Ford is still pulling off Indiana Jones' fedora and leather jacket combo - and still seems to be in the same shape he was when Raiders of the Lost Ark came out 40 years ago. Ford has reportedly undertaken a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"grueling exercise regime"</a> to get in shape for Indiana Jones 5, which includes cycling up to 40 miles a day. Ford also cut out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meat and dairy</a>, telling Ellen DeGeneres in 2020: "I eat vegetables and fish, but I've cut out dairy. I just decided I was tired of eating meat, and I know it's not really good for the planet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ford's trainer also expanded on his fitness routine, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>: "[Indiana Jones] required great co-coordination, and so we worked on routines that helped his reflexes, general body conditioning, and building his core strength using dumbbells, medicine balls. It was all about helping him sustain the pace and avoid injury."</p><p>"We don't include running because that's not good for your knees and back as you get older," trainer Jamie Milne continued. "None of the workouts are about vanity or making him look good either. There's no need - he already does. They're to help him sustain his flexibility and stamina."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Harrison Ford Didn't Like His Time On Star Wars</a></span></p><h2 id=harrison-ford-has-been-hanging-out-with-family><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Harrison Ford Has Been Hanging Out With Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While recovering from his shoulder injury, Ford was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted visiting Croatia</a> with his wife Calista Flockhart and the couple's son Liam.</p><p>“Harrison never thought he’d become a late-in-life dad, but it’s been a tremendous blessing to him,” one of Ford's friends<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> shared in 2019</a>. “He has been mindful to give Liam his full attention.”</p><p>Ford is actually the father of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 children </a>- Ben, Willard, Malcom, Georgia, and Liam.
