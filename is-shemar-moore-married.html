For all of those wondering why the 51-year-old is not married, it's because of his hectic work schedule.

I love what I do for a living. I love it from 'action' to 'cut,' but I also want to walk my dogs, travel, get married, have kids. I want balance, and it's hard to do with the schedule that we have."&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, in an interview for Watch! magazine, Shemar also said that he wants to settle down. "I want to be a family man. I want to be a father, I want to have a partner in crime, a woman to share [my life] with," he said.</p><p>He added, "I want to continue to evolve, I want to continue to take the next step in my life. In my personal life."</p><p>And his wish is finally coming true! He and his girlfriend Jesiree are expecting a baby girl.
