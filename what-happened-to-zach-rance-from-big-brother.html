Due to Zach’s zany persona that exuded the frat energy of his University of Florida alma mater, he quickly became a fan-favorite contestant. Despite his entire run being characterized by various alliances and betrayals, he was nonetheless a top-three America’s Favorite Houseguest contestant but ultimately lost to Donny Thompson. In the end, Derrick Levasseur became victorious in the overall competition of the show.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>One point of speculation from fans was Zach’s close friendship with another contestant, the Broadway actor and singer Frankie Grande. The two seemed so inseparable that some wondered if there was not an underlying backbone of romance propping up the companionship, despite Frankie later betraying Zach in the course of the show. That betrayal would later prove to not be a deal breaker for Frankie and Zach’s relationship after the show ended.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Mental Health Collection (@mentalhealthcollection)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Frankie, the brother of pop singer Ariana Grande, continued hanging out with Zach long after the cameras stopped rolling. In fact, the two crossed paths at a Halloween party at Ariana’s house, Zach later recalled. It was at that party that Zach discovered an aspect of his personality that was hidden from himself until that moment.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Zach, who is now a life coach, ended up hooking up with Frankie at the party, confirming many fan theories about the underlying romantic tension present in the pair’s relationship. Zach explained that the incident made him question himself, he told <a href=#>US Weekly</a> in 2020.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>“I woke up the next day with, like, a heavy heart. I was like, ‘What the [heck] did I just do?’ And then I was like, ‘Wait a second, no, like, maybe I’m gay,’” Zach told the publication.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>After some understandable mental health struggles, Zach eventually accepted the fact that he is bisexual. As he explained: “I prefer women, but this is where I’m at. I’m, like, 85 percent straight.”</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>At first, Zach figured his third-base hookup in Frankie’s closet was a one-off fluke. However, he said after becoming intimate with another man, a photographer, he finally accepted his sexuality.&nbsp;Zach explained that part of his hesitancy for self-acceptance may have been due to his background coming from a frat bro culture in his youth, but since now he is more mature, it is the perfect time for coming out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Mental Health Collection (@mentalhealthcollection)</a></p></figure><p>“As a 23-year-old frat star from the U.S., if any of my friends knew I hooked up with a guy, it would be blasphemy. But now, at 30 years old, as someone who has seen a little bit more of life, I don’t really care what my college friends think of me, and if my colleagues and my employees and my business partners are gonna not want to do business with me because of my sexual orientation. That’s something I want to know now instead of later.”</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Even though coming out inundated Zach’s Instagram inbox with messages of support and gratitude from others going through similar issues, it was not all sunshine and roses in the months following his Big Brother departure. In fact, Zach said he was in a dark place and struggled with mental health issues and drug abuse. Not helping matters was Zach’s self-admittedly inflated ego from becoming an overnight celebrity and gaining hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram.</p><p>“Everything came crashing down, especially because of my addiction to coke and drugs. I was just going to LIV in Miami every single night, getting tables and just drinking and doing blow until 5 a.m. […] And I did that for, like, six months. And this was right after the Frankie thing.”</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Though Frankie has yet to publicly confirm or deny the hookup, Zach said they are still in contact to this day — but not in a romantic capacity.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Gratefully, despite the temporary glamor of becoming a reality TV star going to his head at one point, Zach has since “learned from it” and claims to be “super humble and mindful and spiritual and healthy.” Through this experience, he has taken to helping others who went through a similar hard time, including other reality TV stars who are “crashing hard” and need support.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptmrJ9ix6Kvx2apmqaTmnqnvs6mZJuhl2Kvs7vToZyrZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amd-quietly-releases-lowend-oem-radeon-600-series-radeon-rebadge-2019.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>AMD Quietly Releases Low-End OEM Radeon 600 Series: Radeon Rebadge 2019</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vulture-investigates-what-is-toni-basils-mickey-really-about-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vulture Investigates: Is Toni Basils Mickey Really AboutWell, You Know?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
