notable trends are starting to happen.&nbsp; The software is being probed more and more for weaknesses (such as the <a href=#>recent Mt.Gox issues</a>), and the prices of scrypt mining hardware such as AMD GPUs are going through the roof in the US, at one point hitting <a href=#>$900 for an R9 290X</a>, but quickly dropping to $700 – still well above the MSRP at launch.&nbsp; We have reported on motherboards from ASRock and Biostar being released <a href=#>specifically for coin mining</a>, probing the market to test for volume.&nbsp; Many system integrators (like SCAN or OCUK in the UK) will also sell you a fully built system designed to mine coins.&nbsp; Naturally the next progression is chassis production.</p><p>Up until this point, finding ways in which to place your GPUs can be tricky – this is especially true if you are in a limited space environment.&nbsp; Many enthusiasts in this area will look at multiple things – initial price of hardware, coin production, and throughput density (GPUs in a motherboard/case).&nbsp; At least three of the regular editors here at AnandTech are casually involved in mining to various degrees of success, including me – I am running a few systems at around a dozen cards, which can be quite noisy and generate some heat.&nbsp; There are others who <a href=#>take it to the extreme</a>, and will run hundreds of GPUs.&nbsp;</p><p>Building a setup for mining cards can be difficult.&nbsp; Cases cause heat to build up, but are more stackable than open-air setups.&nbsp; There is also an issue of noise and heat direction – finding a source for that cold air and somehow getting rid of the hot stuff.&nbsp; For those that monitor the mining forums, there are many fixes to this issue – some home brew, some involving Ikea, others with elaborate shelving units on wheels, and the crate method (<a href=#>examples of each</a>).</p><p>For users without the time to invest in case design, <a href=#>Red Harbinger</a> is testing the market with their new mining chassis, the DopaMINE:</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7770/20140217190304-Miner_white_2_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Red Harbinger is known in case design circles for some innovative products, such as <a href=#>The Cross Desk</a> (a £1200 desk claimed to be ‘the last desk you will ever buy’), and the DopaMINE is the latest thought from the small outfit.&nbsp; This product is to initially be crowd funded – many of the companies making mining-specific products are often wary about sale volume, so this is a good way to complete orders before production starts.</p><p>The DopaMINE is designed to be a six GPU, one motherboard + dual power supply case, capable of being stacked as well as providing sufficient airflow.&nbsp; The chassis will support mini-ITX all the way through to E-ATX, have three 120/140mm fan mounts on the bottom, and has 685mm x 508mm x 305mm dimensions.&nbsp; The chassis will come in black, with a limited edition run in white as well.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7770/20140217185951-Fans_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7770/20140217190237-stackable_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Red Harbinger are also promoting the chassis as a test bed / open-air chassis, which can be repurposed as a compute machine if the bottom falls out of scrypt mining.&nbsp; The early bird versions are currently $200 each, with the main run will cost $250 – this includes shipping within the US, add $50 for international shipping.&nbsp; In a field where saving a few dollars here or there makes a big difference, the DopaMINE is perhaps expensive as a case, but it does condense systems into easy-to-handle units.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7770/20140217185925-Expansion_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>On a closer look it might seem that stacking the machines might be pointless if the heat from one set of miners is used to cool another set.&nbsp; Ideally there needs to be some cross airflow left/right as well as bottom to top, and as I was discussing with Ryan earlier, blower GPUs might work best.</p><p>As this is a <a href=#>crowd-funded project</a>, there is no guarantee that the goal will be reached, but it will be an interesting marker for mining chassis from other companies.&nbsp; Red Harbinger is currently looking at an August estimated delivery date, with a $20,000 goal to be reached by April 4th.&nbsp; I have put an order in for a white one – at the very least I should be able to condense three of my chassis down to one, or I will put it to work for compute.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Indiegogo</a></p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/7770/20140217190550-dimensions2_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIR4g49oqZ6cXZ2us67Ip56eql2psrTA0maroZ1dmL%2B6vNOomq6qopq7pMWMnJ%2Baq6OewG65wKuinqxdqbWmecOop5qlmaOy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tanya-tucker-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tanya Tucker Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./apple-m1-max-performance-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Huge Memory Bandwidth, but not for every Block</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy;
