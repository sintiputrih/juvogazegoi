All his life, Capone used violence, cunning, and ruthless determination to get everything that he wanted. And for a time during Prohibition, he had it all.</p><p>But it all came to an end on June 16, 1931, when Capone pled guilty to tax evasion in federal court after his lawyer carelessly confessed on his behalf in a letter to the authorities. Always the braggart, Capone walked out of court and boasted to the press that his deal only carried a two-and-a-half-year sentence and that he’d be back on the street in no time.</p><p>Back in court for formal sentencing, the judge informed Capone that the court had no obligation to impose the agreed-upon sentence. After a full trial, the jury sentenced Al Capone to 11 years in federal prison, of which he served eight.</p><p>In his time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Al Capone</a> reigned as the king of Chicago. At a time when the average American earned $750 a year, Al Capone admitted to making $100,000 from illegal bootlegging.</p><p>Just as a fortune could be made in the ’20s from the underground traffic in alcohol, today’s drug prohibition has made billionaires out of thugs like Capone all over the world. Here are three of the worst and most infamous gangsters alive today.</p><h2>Infamous Gangsters: Semion Yudkovich Mogilevich</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-79006 alt="Modern Gangsters Semion Table" width=900 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/modern-gangsters-semion-table-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-79006 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Taringa</span></p><p>Half the battle in becoming an organized crime boss is cultivating a titanic ego. Many of the most successful gangsters in history have imagined themselves to be the biggest, baddest alpha wolves who ever lived. Most of these were just empty boasts, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Semion Mogilevich</a> can actually make a case for himself as the boss of bosses.</p><p>Mogilevich is unusual in the Russian underworld for being an educated man. He earned a degree in economics prior to building his criminal empire, and has put whatever he learned about the subject at the then-communist University of Lviv to good use.</p><p>In a career that’s lasted over 40 years, Mogilevich has risen to the top of Russia’s organized crime scene, laundered tens of billions of dollars, and even bought his own arms factory. He holds citizenship in Russia, Ukraine, Hungary and Israel. That last one is probably the most important; Israel never extradites its citizens, so if the law ever starts closing in on him, Mogilevich has a convenient bolthole to spend his retirement in.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-79040 alt="Semion Mogilevich Fbi" width=494 height=282 data-sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/semion-mogilevich-fbi.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-79040 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>FBI</span><span class=caption-body>Official FBI wanted poster for Semion Mogilevich.</span></p><p>Mogilevich’s links to Israel go back to the early 1980s, when he was fresh off of a three-year stretch in prison for fraud. During that time, large numbers of Russian and Ukrainian Jews – and more than a few dissidents who were willing to say they were Jews – were migrating out of the Soviet Union and into the Occupied Territories.</p><p>Mogilevich got into the business of facilitating emigres’ trips as if he was a freelance travel agent. Unlike a travel agent, however, he usually demanded a percentage of the refugees’ net worth up front, and then he generally stole anything they left behind and expected to be shipped after them. Mogilevich used the money from this to bribe officials into looking the other way and letting his business carry on unmolested.</p><p>With the fall of the Soviet Union, Russian and Chechen gangsters went from shadowy criminals on the fringe of society to elected leaders and business tycoons. Few, if any, of them really left behind their criminal enterprises, and Mogilevich was no exception. Throughout the 1990s, he ran so many street-level scams that even the FBI has a hard time listing them all, from gangster mainstays such as drugs and prostitution to enforcement and insurance fraud.</p><p>In one scheme, Mogilevich sold untaxed heating oil to consumers as gasoline, which must have worked well on their Trabants and Volga sedans. Like a good economist, Mogilevich laundered the money through New York and London, and then he bought “legitimate” stakes in oil and gas companies.</p><p>Given that Russia has more oil than Kuwait, and that former Soviet oil companies were being sold for kopeks on the ruble, this was a really good move. It was around this time that Mogilevich bought a controlling share in Sukhoi, which manufactures fighter jets, and a Hungarian arms company that makes anti-aircraft guns.</p><p>Today, the 65-year-old Mogilevich lives in Kiev, surrounded by private security and basically immune to the law. Like Capone, he was brought up on tax evasion charges a few years ago, but Vladimir Putin’s government let him go, saying that he wasn’t charged with anything really serious. This despite the strong suspicion that he’s had scores of people killed and still runs a massive criminal empire on three continents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyqusWapKito2K0orrGrKueqqNiwLW1y6VkoqZdl8K0tc2eqqw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./antonio-gates-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Antonio Gates Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cozy-fall-essentials-amazon-nordstrom-revolve.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>21 Sleep and Loungewear Essentials to Win the Brisk Fall Season</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
