If you want proof of that, look no further than his latest podcast episode reaction to the 6ix God's new collaboration with Camila Cabello on her album C,XOXO. Moreover, maybe folks mostly remember Joe's thoughts on Drizzy through the lens of the recent <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> beef. While he might not always like Aubrey when he acts tough, he does like him with the melodies pretty often.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, you can see from The Joe Budden Podcast's general reaction to "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">HOT UPTOWN</a>" that not everyone was as impressed and into it as the titular host. "That's enough, that's enough," Budden said of the Drake collaboration about a minute into it. "We don't need to hear no more of that. Who don't know that that's a hit? Who don't know that that's going to take the game where it needs to be? Come on, for the summertime? Coming off of the beef? Perfect thing to do."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-joe-budden-podcast-reacts-to-drake-s-camila-cabello-collabs>The Joe Budden Podcast Reacts To Drake's Camila Cabello Collabs</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere during The Joe Budden Podcast's discussion, they spoke on how Drake took things back to a lot of his earlier breezy hits and catchiness. Some folks were "thrown off" by this approach, but the consensus was mostly positive, especially when considering it in a summer context. It's similar to how <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">folks responded to this</a> and the "Uugly" interlude online: some appreciate the melodic approach, others praise it in a back-handed manner, and some people are just haters. The way the cookie crumbles.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, we wonder if these new Drake tracks will impact folks' current discussion around <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">who is the better rapper</a> between him and Kendrick Lamar. We definitely know that Joe Budden feels pretty confident in the latter, but rap artists don't always have to be lyrical masterminds to get praise. No matter how much we play this song in the summer, it's exciting to move forward for both of these artists. Despite their decade-plus-long run, platforms like The Joe Budden Podcast show that folks are still very excited about what they have to offer in any capacity.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.
