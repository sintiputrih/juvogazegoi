Today, the sharing website sees more and more people making a career on the platform every day.&nbsp;But, even though the YouTube career looks attractive, the task is huge because before you can be called a successful YouTuber, you must have done your homework well, from creating a name for yourself to creating of a chain.&nbsp;Onision is one of those people who took the bull by the horn, met the above criteria, and became one of many YouTubers to be reckoned with.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bio (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Onision was born Gregory Daniel Jackson on November 11, 1985. Greg’s parents reportedly divorced after his father was convicted of sexually assaulting a minor.&nbsp;Greg was then only two years old.</span></p><p><span>There have been conflicting reports about where he was born and raised.&nbsp;He was initially thought to have grown up in Oregon because he once mentioned going to school in Oregon, then he purged the air, claiming he had never lived in Oregon.</span></p><p><span>Other available information suggested that his birthplace and hometown would be Auburn, Washington, and others said it was in Washington (we have yet to confirm this information).</span></p><p><span>Greg was sent to juvenile prison at the age of 15 after repeatedly punching his father in the chest in self-defense for physically assaulting him.&nbsp;This experience would explain why the themes of most of her videos center around her struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts: That’s Life.</span></p><p><span>In one of his videos, he recounted how he took a gun to the head while serving in the Air Force.&nbsp;Greg has used his experiences very well to help others serve as a peer counselor.</span></p><p><span>He loves his mother very much as seen in some of his videos like&nbsp;</span><span>Ghosts caught on camera.</span></p><p><strong><span>See also: Who is Billy Unger?&nbsp;His age, height, does he have a girlfriend or is he gay?</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>About his&nbsp;</span><span id=YouTube_career class=mw-headline><span>YouTube Career</span></span></strong></h2><p><span>His YouTube career started in January 2006 when he created his first Onision channel.&nbsp;His early videos featured a “voice-changing” Darth Vader helmet.</span></p><p><span>He launched his second channel OnisionArchive, in 2008.&nbsp;While the first channel had more satirical videos, the second served as a secondary channel where it added additional content, as well as advertisements.</span></p><p><span>The stories posted on this second channel revolved around topics regarding suicide, self-harm, body issues, he also took the time to answer questions he received on his forum.</span></p><p><span>In 2009, Greg launched his third channel OnisionSpeaks.&nbsp;The channel known to him and fans simply as&nbsp;</span><i><span>Parle</span></i><span>&nbsp;is his own way of creating and supporting awareness of vegetarianism.&nbsp;The OnisionSpeaks channel eventually became his main peer help and advice channel.</span></p><p><span>His most recent channel, UhOhBro, went live in 2012. He uploads videos there showing how he researched and reacted to various topics he got from Google.&nbsp;One of his most-watched videos is&nbsp;</span><span>I’m a Banana</span><span>, which has garnered over 61 million views and over 760,000 likes.</span></p><p><span>Her appearance on YouTube sparked mixed feelings and some received her videos negatively.&nbsp;He is therefore considered one of the most controversial YouTubers.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Greg’s net worth is estimated at $2.3 million.&nbsp;Most of his income comes from his YouTube channels.</span></p><p><span>With over two million and over 570 million views, Onision reportedly generates an estimated revenue of around $100 per day and $36,000 per year, while OnisionSpeaks, with over $1.9 million subscribers and over 150,000 views per day, generates around $270 per day from YouTube ads.</span></p><p><span>Greg also sells merchandise on his sites which also generates income for him.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is he gay?&nbsp;Wife girlfriend, kids</span></strong></h2><p><span>Since Greg carries the portfolio of being a controversial YouTuber, you can imagine his sexual orientation won’t be far from controversial.</span></p><p><span>Fans wanted to know if he was gay and in 2013 he took to his Twitter account to clear things up.&nbsp;In a Tweet dated July 9, 2013, Greg wrote, “I’m not gay, I watch, ring and do the gay act.”</span></p><p><span>He was married twice.&nbsp;His first marriage was to Skye Tantaga.&nbsp;The couple were together from 2005 to 2011. He has been married to Taylor Anderson since 2012. The couple reportedly have two children and they have decided not to use social media.</span></p><p><span>He had a relationship with Canadian pop singer and songwriter,&nbsp;</span><span id=Relationship_with_Shiloh_Hoganson class=mw-headline><span>Shiloh Hoganson and Adrienne Jourgenson.</span></span></p><h2><strong><span>Height: How tall is Onision?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Onision is 5ft 11in tall and weighs 60kg.&nbsp;The YouTube sensation was a United States Air Force aviator before casting him for a career in internet commerce.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGinnp7AqrvNZq6inpVisKm1y52pnqZdlrSmecaiqaWeop6yr7CMp5ytZaekv7W0jKGcop%2BYqXqqv4yhnGafka58</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amara-la-negra-net-worth-125895.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amara La Negra Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./basilisk-pilgrims-badge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Medieval Pilgrim Badge Depicting A Basilisk Discovered In Poland</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
