Known for his elaborate get-ups and attire, Newton’s fashion choices have been raising eyebrows for years. He’s been known to throw on a multicultured suit and a massive hat.</p><p id=par-3_32>Just like his fashions, Newton’s home life has also been up for discussion. Now, the proud father is getting candid about his children and what being a stepdad means to him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cam-Newton.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-many-children-does-cam-newton-have>How many children does Cam Newton have?</h2><p id=par-4_36>On Father’s Day 2020, Newton shared that he was a proud father of seven. The 31-year-old, listed all of his children’s names, Jaden, Shakira, Chosen, Sovereign-Dior, Camidas, Ceaser, and Cashmere. In his <a href=#>Instagram</a> post, Newton shared,</p><p>I’M A PROUD FATHER OF 7 &lt;&lt; A DADDY isn’t defined as the man who makes the child (NOT in all instances), but rather a MAN who extends his hands and time to help with the child’s raising and his heart to LOVE the child through anything!! Blood doesn’t always make you [a] DADDY. Being a DAD comes from the heart… ANYBODY CAN MAKE A BABY BUT IT TAKES A REAL MAN TO RAISE A CHILD!! Kudos to ALL THE REAL MEN worldwide!!

During an episode of Sip N’ Smoke, he explained that he loves having his kids come with him to work.</p><p id=par-9_47>“For them to kind of witness me working, that’s nice. They always hear, ‘Dad, he’s gone for a couple of days. What is he doing?’” he said via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ESSENCE</a>. “You have to really allow them to see that when daddy’s not here. This is what he’s doing.”</p><p id=par-10_77>Being with his children is the most important thing for Newton. He explained that he loves taking them to school. “I just want them to know love,” he shared. “I just want them to know that feeling because I had it. I grew up in a three-parent household — my mom, my dad, and my grandma — and they showed me that on a regular basis and that’s just what I want to provide to my children.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cam-newton-just-got-candid-about-being-a-stepdad>Cam Newton just got candid about being a stepdad</h2><p id=par-11_54>When it comes to his stepchildren, Newton also explains that he doesn’t see any difference between them. “I just always allow them to know that I’m here.
