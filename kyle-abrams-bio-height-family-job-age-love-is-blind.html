Well, considering their conflicting perspective about religion, and Kyle’s “necessary compromises,” it was only expected of the duo to fall apart.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s take a look at what happened, from the very beginning.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Among the 15 females who competed on Netflix’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love is Blind</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 2, Kyle developed a strong connection with Shaina Hurley. The two bonded over being old souls with their mothers as their biggest influences, and also since Kyle’s profession was the same as that of Shaina’s parents, the two were able to find a common ground.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As the bond got deeper, Shaina didn’t mind even revealing that she’d been engaged once before, and it didn’t work out as her fiancee was “very controlling.” But instead of being put off, Kyle assured the lady before cheekily adding, “and then you met me.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Though sure that the two wanted each other, Kyle and Shaina both then continued their exploration — with Shaina eyeing Shayne Jansen. However, Shayne had taken a liking to Natalie Lee. Even on the decision day, when Shaina confessed to Shayne, she had deep feelings for him, he shut her down!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thus, Shaina zeroed out on Kyle.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Shaina was still happy to have Kyle as her partner. But again, while all was going well between the two, they realized one major problem — Shaina was a devout Christian, while Kyle was an atheist!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The disparities caused quite a conflict between the duo. But Kyle said that he was ready to make the necessary compromises, and proposed to Shaina.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Surprisingly, she said “Yes!”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Maybe the fact that Kyle gave Shaina his mother’s engagement ring to prove his sincerity, might have affected the lady’s judgment.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The pair slept in separate rooms on the very first night of their getaway, and eventually, Shaina decided that she would go back home&nbsp; — to Chicago — all by herself.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Undeterred, Kyle still managed to reach out to her once he went back to Illinois. But Shaina just couldn’t make peace with the fact that Kyle was an atheist.</span></p><h3><b>Kyle Abrams Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kyle Abrams was 29 years of age when he first appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love is Blind </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He is 3 years younger than the then-32-year-old hairstylist, Shaina Hurley.</span></p><p><b>Trivia: </b><span style=font-weight:400>All excited to appear on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Is Blind</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Kyle took it to his IG on Feb 2, 2022, to share, “Will this KYLE find love behind the wall or punch through it? Find out on @netflix @loveisblindnetflix February 11th!”</span></p><h3><b>Kyle Abrams Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kyle Abrams is a Glazier.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>What’s that? Well, Kyle’s job as a “glazier” asks him to be the lead for measuring, installing, and repairing glass in houses, hotels, shops, and offices. In simple words, Kyle was a glass expert.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, a glazier in the US made around $40 thousand per annum.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Kyle wasn’t working, he love spending time in the sea; especially jet skiing. But Kyle isn’t just your average jet skier — the guy can fly the boats 6 inches above the waves!

Reptodlty, Brittany married her husband on November 10, 2018, at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mickey Finn’s Brewery</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, Kyle’s grandmother has long passed away.
