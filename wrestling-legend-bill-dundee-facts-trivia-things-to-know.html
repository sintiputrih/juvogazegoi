One of the more notable of his career was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working for Mid-South Wrestling</a>, the result of MSW business being down while Memphis was on a hot streak. Dundee’s booking revitalized the territory in 1984 and 1986 thanks to some Memphis-style storylines and employing some fast-paced matches and younger wrestlers to add some variety to the cards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=worked-for-wcw><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Worked For WCW</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/william-regal-sir-william.jpg><p>Bill Dundee also spent some time booking WCW, but he also became an on-screen character on WCW television in the early 1990s.

On top of horning in on everyone’s territories, ICW would also <a href=#>antagonize their rival promotions</a> in various ways, creating a tense situation and leading to an altercation between Randy Savage and Bill Dundee in the parking lot of a Tennessee gym in 1982.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Wrestlers That Macho Man Randy Savage Had Beef With (& 5 That He Loved)</a></span></p><p>Details on the incident vary, but basically an outnumbered Dundee pulled a gun and Savage struck Dundee, breaking his face.

Additionally, he gained a pro wrestling son-in-law when his daughter Donna married “Beautiful” Bobby Eaton, a tag team specialist who’d prove to be highly influential as part of <a href=#>the legendary team</a> the Midnight Express, which put on numerous classics with the Rock ‘n’ Roll Express and other teams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=won-a-title-at-75><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Won A Title At 75</span></h2><p>Much like his on-again, off-again tag team partner Jerry Lawler, Bill Dundee never really retired, and <a href=#>continued to wrestle into his 70s</a>.
