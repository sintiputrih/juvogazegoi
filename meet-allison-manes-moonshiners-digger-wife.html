But though he’s graced over 114 episodes, fans only knew a little about his married life; and none whatsoever about his wife Allison Manes.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, here we are with all the information on the mysterious </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moonshiners</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> Digger’s wife!</span></p><h3><b>Meet Allison Manes, Moonshiners Star Digger Wife</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Allison Manes and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moonshiners</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star Digger have been together for a decade. But though the two loved each other to the moon, they weren’t vocal about their love on social media — except for the time Digger wished his wife a happy birthday on FB in 2019.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Happy birthday to my sweet, loving(and patient) wife,” he started the post before adding how much she meant to him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the star, he would be spinning his wheels constantly without her. Digger also acknowledged his “crazy life and schedule” and thanked her for loving him unconditionally. “As Mark always says there ain’t no sense in our wives staying mad at us because we’re ignorant. Thanks for loving me,” he added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Allison and Digger’s earliest post together on FB was back in June 2013. However, the world only knew about them, after Digger took to Instagram to share a double date with his work buddy Mark and his wife.</span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moonshiners</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star Digger is the owner of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Back Alley Grainery</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, where he sells brewing and winemaking supplies. He’s been making moonshine in the Smoky Mountains for more than 40 years. Infact, his journey started at 14 after he received family permission to learn to make liquor from a friend’s dad. However, he only stepped into the limelight thanks to the Discovery show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moonshiners</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ironically, the star is an outlaw. He could get caught on the job if anyone wanted to do anything about their activities.</span></p><h3><b>Moonshiners Star Digger And Allison Manes Kids</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Allison Manes shares at least one son with </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moonshiners</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star Digger. Their little one is named Beck, and he’s already grown up.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Taking a look at all the pics Allison has of her son, it seems Beck grew up fishing with his dad. But we’ve no idea if he inherited the moonshiner’s skill.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides Beck, Allison also has two sons (step) named Jim, and Joseph Bo Denton.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2022, Jim resided in Sevierville, Tennessee with his wife and their two beautiful kids. While Joseph lived in Newport, Tennessee with his wife Taylor Denton. There, he worked in Sales at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mountain Motorsports Kodak</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. He is a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Cocke County High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> graduate who studied Industrial Maintenance at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Tennessee College of Applied Technology Morristown</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Coincidentally, both Jim and Joseph celebrate their wedding anniversaries on October 20.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On their anniversary in 2020, Allison took to her FB to share pics of both her sons and daughter-in-law, captioned, “My two oldest boys both celebrate anniversaries today!! One celebrated with his wife all day because it was his day off and hers too! The other worked and then brought pizza to his wife and me!!! I love you all very much! Thanks for giving me, daughters!”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, on national sons day, Allison posed beside her sons, and captioned her Fb pic, “I almost missed son’s day! I am the mother of sons! I couldn’t be more proud of the men these three have become(one still a young man) love them so much!”</span></p><h3><b>Allison Manes Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Allison Manes was 52 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She is 6 years younger than her husband </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moonshiners</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star Digger.</span></p><h3><b>Allison Manes Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Allison Manes is the owner of a clothing boutique named </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Fruit Jar Alley</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She opened the boutique (with her husband) in her hometown of Newport, Tennessee to help revitalize Newport before expanding into other areas in Tennessee.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Explaining the name behind her company, Allison said, “The concept of Fruit Jar Alley was to turn something that wasn’t very good into something great.” It seems </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Fruit Jar Alley</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was a notorious alley from her youth that had several bars that are no longer vacated.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Surprisingly, while many businesses went out of commission, hers thrived during the pandemic. They had about a 30% increase. How? Well, the store offered a wide variety of products both online and in its retail locations in Knoxville, Pigeon Forge, and Newport. The store is marketed as a boutique but features a diverse set of goods that go far beyond a traditional boutique. “We sell everything in this store, from soap to dish towels to clothing,” Allison added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Another reason they were so popular was because of their affordability. Though quality accessories and clothing, the price seemed reasonable.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides clothing, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Fruit Jar Alley</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> also had their names on lines of coffee, water, and candles, establishing themselves as a merchant of many different types of products.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Fruit Jar Alley</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was incorporated back in November 2017.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here’s their FB @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>fruitjaralley</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Is Allison Manes On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>We couldn’t find Allison on Instagram.
