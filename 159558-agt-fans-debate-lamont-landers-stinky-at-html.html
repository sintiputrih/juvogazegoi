Lamont auditioned for the TV show and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a28195334/agt-2019-judge-simon-cowell-lamont-landers-reaction/>got four yeses </a>from all the judges.</p><p class=dh>At the genesis of his audition, one of the judges, <a class="me a" href=#>Simon Cowell, stopped his act,</a> he felt his song choice was "safe." The singer's first two song choices were Marvin Gaye's "What's going on," and Al Greene's "Let's Stay Together." Simon halted his performances by letting him know how poorly he did with the selection of the song. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a28199882/agt-2019-judge-simon-cowell-lamont-landers-reaction/>In his words</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Your problem is that you don't take risks."</p><p class=dh>Conversely, Simon's observation was met by a defensive Lamont who waded off the comment with nonchalance. The chap shrugged, and the show's judge noticed this and responded to it by commenting on the behaviour, and giving him a third chance! <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a28199882/agt-2019-judge-simon-cowell-lamont-landers-reaction/>According to him</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Lamont, I wouldn't shrug to that, I wouldn't. So you want to come back this afternoon? It's not me; it's you."</p><p class=dh>The contestant wasn't having any of this, as he boldly walked down the stage to ask for the audience' opinion! Simon felt somewhat disrespected with this act and decided to call him to order. In the end, the judge gave him yet a third chance but added in<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a28199882/agt-2019-judge-simon-cowell-lamont-landers-reaction/> his closing remarks</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Don't be cocky."</p><p class=dh>The singer's third attempt to wow the judges alongside his audiences was fruitful, after much ranting backstage on how tediously he's had to rehearse.</p><p class=dh>Lamont came with a blast in his last performance, and bang! swept all four judges away. This time Gabrielle Union, Julianne Hough, Howie Mandel and of course, Simon Cowell all gave their acceptance for his talent. Simon may have noticed his efforts and applauded his courage, but the viewers at home thought differently.</p><p class=dh>Whichever the response was from home, the good thing for Lamont is that he got through his first stage, we hope he scales through subsequently. The young artist also apologized for his "stinky attitude" earlier on.</p><p class=dh>It may seem hard to impress the judges, but coming out on such a platform, one needs to bring on a show-stopping performance.</p><p class=dh>That was precisely what 25-year-old<a class="me a" href=#> Ben Trigger</a> did. The gay dancer triggered all four yeses from the judges, with his humorous performance and even <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ben-trigger-golden-buzzer-americas-got-talent_n_5d1335c6e4b0aa375f55de24>hit the golden buzzer himself! </a>Yeah right, although he didn't get a golden buzzer from anyone on the panel, as they say, you want something done right, do it yourself!</p><p class=dh>Hopefully, Lamont continues to deliver an impressive performance, and maybe, just maybe, everyone might like him!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpscm1lbXqis9NmnZqmo2Kxpq7ArZxmpJGivK%2FAjKWYp5yVp8Buv9OipaSxXZbBb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-lynx-violent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are lynx violent?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kapos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Prisoners-Turned-Guards Of The Holocaust</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
