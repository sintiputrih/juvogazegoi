Noom has gained more than 50 million downloads and has claimed to help consumers lose weight through healthier habits.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">However, between Aug. 6, 2019 and Aug. 6, 2020, the Better Business Bureau received 1,185 consumer complaints.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/200819_gma_jarvis1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">According to a statement from the BBB, "consumers reportedly try to cancel the trial offer before it ends but still end up being billed for the subscriptions."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">After a free trial, the BBB says consumers were led to believe that the cost of a monthly membership was between $20 and $40, but instead discovered they were "charged for several months upfront upon the free trial's end," with charges from $120 to $180 or more.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">On top of that, customers have complained to the bureau that it's reportedly difficult to get in contact with Noom's customer service to request refunds.</p><p><h2 class="KuBv lFzl GbVC HkWF HfYh kGyA SwCr">Editor’s Picks</h2></p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Consumers are consistently telling us that they have difficulty contacting Noom's customer service in order to get a refund," Claire Rosenzweig, president of Better Business Bureau in New York, told "Good Morning America."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Lisa Wolfe, a public relations executive from Chicago, says she tried to cancel Noom multiple times after deciding it wasn't for her. She said it was "almost impossible."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Wolfe said she was charged almost $400 in subscription fees over six months. In June, after she couldn't get a hold of customer service, she tweeted a complaint to the company.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">She said that was when the company gave her a full refund.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In response to these complaints, Noom CEO and co-founder Saeju Jeong said in a written statement, "While the complaints on BBB represent less than 0.03% of the millions of customers who have signed up with Noom in the last 3 years, we take each one very seriously. Our top priority is to always ensure our customers have the best possible experience with Noom. This holds true no matter where they are in the program—including if Noom is not the right fit for them at any point along their journey."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Like many industry-leading fitness and wellness companies, we sell multi-month membership packages, and we state clearly and in advance the full charges that customers can expect to be billed for that membership if they decide that Noom is right for them," Jeong added. "We are very accommodating with refund requests, even with those who cancel and request a refund shortly after the trial period has passed. Customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked, either by messaging their coach in the app or emailing our support team."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/noom-ht-ps-200818_1597839421066_hpEmbed_2_17x10_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Still, due to the high volume of complaints received in the past year, the BBB has given Noom a "D" rating and is urging consumers to be wary about signing up for free trial offers.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Here are some tips to follow before you sign up for a free trial:</p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR">1. Fully understand all the terms and conditions</h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The Better Business Bureau warns of "subscription traps" that "hook customers into paying for expensive products or services that they did not intend or agree to buy." So before signing up, the bureau advises to see what the terms say and if it takes payments from your credit card until you cancel.</p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR">2. Determine your fitness goals and check the details</h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Everyone knows how hard it is to lose weight. To make sure you find a program that aligns with your weight loss goals, the BBB suggests finding a program that you enjoy with goals that seem reasonable and "understand how the product or service is supposed to work."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka>WATCH: Woman loses over 100 pounds following the 'lazy keto' diet</strong></p><p class=Caption__Title aria-hidden=true><span class=RichText>Woman loses over 100 pounds following the 'lazy keto' diet</span></p><p><span class="Truncate Truncate--collapsed"><span><span class=RichText>"It's keto without all of the hardcore rules.”</span></span></span></p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR">3. Be wary of 'overpromises' in advertisements and customer testimonials</h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The BBB pointed out how some programs promise unrealistic results. According to the <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, evidence suggests that <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>healthy weight loss goals</a> are 1 to 2 pounds a week. It's also not about a "diet" or "program," but healthy, long-term healthy habits and changes, according to the CDC.</p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR">4. Report concerns</h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">If you come across an ad for a weight loss program or product that feels like it's overpromising, the BBB says to report it, contact your BBB and file a report with the Federal Trade Commission.</p><h3 class="vPZu oPAl xcLA bunQ uhXX PjNj lNbo LBPR">Research the company on BBB's website before purchasing</h3><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">If you still need more info on a product or company before purchasing or subscribing, the BBB suggests you check their website to see what people have to say and if there have been any complaints.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCTrHpmkJ2cobumv9Joma6rmaOytL%2BMm6yrnZGqerit0aeqZpufo8C2ucSrqmacmZrBbq3PqWSnp5%2BierW0zq6qmqaUqHy0wM6rsHihlHKEc4CUcGhwaQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./debby-ryan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Debby Ryan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-dudda-artese-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All About Dudda Artese | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
