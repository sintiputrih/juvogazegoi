Even after we got married nothing changed about that. I think that saved us a lot of trouble."</p><p>Beyoncé would go on to admit that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she never felt pressure to get married</a> and in fact, it was very much the opposite. Beyoncé wanted to take her time and make sure she was ready for the next step.</p><p>“No one expected me to run off and get married. I really don’t believe that you will love the same thing when you’re 20 as you do at 30. So that was my rule: Before the age of 25, I would never get married.
