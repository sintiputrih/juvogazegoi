Sometimes you really just want to know more details about <strong>Duchess Kate</strong>’s latest outfits, and that’s where Shop With Us comes in!</p><p>Just recently, Kate and her husband, <strong>Prince William</strong>, hopped on a video call to speak with vulnerable families about the positive impact of the COVID-19 vaccines. She wore a white Holland Cooper bodysuit underneath a blazer, accenting the look with statement diamond <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a>. We were instantly in love with the bodysuit and we knew we wanted to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">channel the look</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/duchess-kate-bodysuit.jpg><p><strong>See it! Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">FAIMILORY Surplice Wrap Ruched Plunge Neck Deep V Long Sleeve Thong Bodysuit</a>!</strong></p><p>Sadly (but not surprisingly), Kate’s bodysuit is now sold out. Considering its original price, however, which was nearly $165, we would have been searching for this more affordable option regardless. We found this bodysuit on Amazon and knew it was the one. Just like Kate’s, it’s white with long sleeves, a faux-wrap design and a thong bottom. You can definitely recreate her look with a piece like this in your arsenal, as well as create so many more winning outfits!</p><p><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">This bodysuit</a> is made of 95% cotton with 5% spandex for stretch. The cotton keeps it soft, skin-friendly and breathable, which is important for when you’re layering it under other pieces, while the stretch factor is obviously always a plus for a fitted silhouette. It also has a surplice neckline and ruching at the side for a flattering effect!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">FAIMILORY Surplice Wrap Ruched Plunge Neck Deep V Long Sleeve Thong Bodysuit </a>for just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$14 </a>at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, March 8, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>You can dress this bodysuit up for a more professional look like Kate’s with your own blazer and trousers, or you can dress it up in a fancier way by pairing it with a flowy skirt and heels. You can also keep it totally casual by wearing it under your favorite pair of jeans in any wash or color. White goes with everything! And if you do want some color, there’s also a bold, red-hot version available.</p><p><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$14</a> to channel a duchess’ look isn’t too bad in our book, especially when it could lead to so many other types of outfits.
