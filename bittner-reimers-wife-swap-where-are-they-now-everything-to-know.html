It’s also one of several signs that television’s long-standing love affair with the housewife is rekindling.</p><p>The premise of “Wife Swap” is deceptively simple: What would happen if two drastically different women swapped families for ten days? Each lady comes in her new home with no prior knowledge of the family she will be taking over, a family chose for its dissimilarity to her own.</p><p>For the first part of their stay, everyone tries to follow the original wife’s behaviors, which are detailed in a handbook. In the second half, she imposes her home rules on the household. In the face of mom-enforced family regulations, families are revealed as miniature nation-states where class, income, and/or real estate holdings have no bearing on domestic life.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Bittner Reimers Wife Swap Where Are They Now?">Bittner Reimers Wife Swap Where Are They Now?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Who Is Melissa Reimers?">Who Is Melissa Reimers?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Who Is Cindy Bittner?">Who Is Cindy Bittner?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bittner-reimers-wife-swap-where-are-they-now></span>Bittner Reimers Wife Swap Where Are They Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Melissa Reimers and Cindy Bittner are the two wives who exchanged their families for the show titled Wife Swap in the event episode of the show.
