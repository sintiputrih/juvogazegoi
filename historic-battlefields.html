It’s far more common for one side to be willing or able to fight and for the other side to collapse at once or wage a guerrilla war than it is for rival armies to roll the dice on a few confrontations. Battles are what happen when both sides actually show up armed and looking for trouble.</p><p>The desperate courage exhibited in battle seems to charge the land itself with energy, as if the places where nations have thrown away the lives of their young men – mostly for reasons that seemed really important at the time – are made sacred with the passage of time. Sometimes the land is literally marked, and sometimes there’s nothing left but a little plaque.</p><p>Below, discover some of the historic battlefields that have scarred the land and marred the pages of your history book, and see how they look today.</p><h2>Gettysburg</h2><img alt="Historic Battlefields Devils Den" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/historic-battlefields-devils-den.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>If the Middle of Nowhere had a capital city, that city would be Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Even today, Gettysburg is an itty-bitty little town in the southeastern corner of the state, and nothing of any global significance happens there. Gettysburg has only been important once, for roughly 72 hours from July 1-3, 1863, when, during the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Civil War</a>, the two largest armies on Earth crashed into each other in and around the town and waged the biggest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere.

Lacking artillery, the only way the Confederates could do that was with house-by-house fighting at extremely close range. It was a bloody mess, and the bodies were left on the ground – in the summer heat – for the better part of a week.

Union General Meade sent over 20,000 men into the gap, where they launched one desperate charge after another, only to be beaten back. However, Longstreet's charge ended soon after at the nearby hill, Little Round Top.

Historians argue that the South never recovered and that this was the tipping point of the war. Legendary southern author William Faulkner once wrote, about the charge: "For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out . . . and it's all in the balance, it hasn't happened yet, it hasn't even begun yet, it not only hasn't begun yet but there is still time for it not to begin. . ." This is the view from the Union position overlooking Pickett's Charge today.

Throughout the Middle Ages, it was known for producing, of all things, sugared almonds. In 1792, French and Prussian forces fought a small battle there, which ended with victory for the Prussians. In 1916, during World War I, the German army decided to focus all its power on crushing the French in the same place. For the rest of the century, old men in both countries would bolt upright in bed, screaming from the horror they survived there.

Every attempt at a breakthrough had failed, and both sides were stalemated in their trenches. The philosophy behind the German attack was as simple as it was brutal: kill everything. Throw so much firepower at the French that there just won't be enough people left alive to resist the German advance. The fight started with one of the heaviest artillery bombardments in history, which is why so much of modern Verdun looks like the world's most challenging golf course today.

No battle had ever been fought on such a scale before, and the fight would drag on for 10 months, from February 21 to December 16. The horrific bloodshed even spun off another battle – the Somme – where the English attacked to relieve some of the pressure on Verdun to the south.

It is likely that the Germans endured about 340,000 casualties in a failed attempt to take the town, while the French endured about 375,000 successfully defending it. Furthermore, the British saw about 420,000 casualties along the Somme River, where there were another approximately 200,000 French casualties and about 600,000 German casualties.

German officers had been given similar orders. Here, a German special forces officer deals with the consequences of that resolve. Note that the gun he's holding is a PPSh Russian submachine gun, suggesting that he's either lost his own weapon or run out of ammunition.
