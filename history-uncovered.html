Six-year-old Dennis Martin ran into the woods while playing a game near his father’s campsite — and vanished forever.</p><p>At 5 a.m the next morning, the search for the six-year-old began in earnest. News of his disappearance had quickly spread, and park rangers, locals, rescue squads, and even a troop of Boy Scouts camping nearby came to try and help. Even the Green Berets joined in. Before long, 240 people fanned out into the woods in hopes of finding Dennis and bringing him home.</p><p>Helicopters buzzed overhead, dogs sniffed through the underbrush, and volunteers worked in high spirits despite the rain, certain that they’d find the missing boy. After all, he hadn’t been missing long.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356442 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/missing-poster.png alt="Dennis Martin Missing Poster" width=900 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-356442 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Park Service</span><span class=caption-body>The Martin family offered a $5,000 reward for information on their missing son.</span></p><p>Dennis’s mother Violet, who’d joined the search, felt optimistic that they’d find her youngest son. She said, “I have a feeling we’re going to find him. Maybe God sent us this ordeal so we could appreciate things more.”</p><p>But though the ranks of searchers swelled over the next couple of days — eventually peaking at 1,400, and even attracting the attention of President Richard Nixon, who monitored the situation from the White House — they found no sign of the missing boy. Nothing of him seemed to remain at all, not even the bright red shirt he’d last been seen wearing.</p><p>It’s been 50 years since Dennis Martin disappeared, and many chilling questions remain. How could someone disappear so quickly? Did he die in the woods? And if he did, had he succumbed to cold or panic? Or did something worse happen to him?</p><p>Theories range from the simple to the sinister. Though some park rangers think that Dennis merely succumbed to the elements, others indeed wonder if the little boy met a much worse fate.</p><p>They’ve speculated that Dennis ran into the woods, and crossed paths with the most dangerous predator of all: a human being.</p><p>At least one witness recalled hearing a blood-curdling scream just after Dennis disappeared, and seeing a man hiding in the bushes. Meanwhile, others point to the legends of the feral humans said to live in the Great Smoky Mountains.</p><p>Though no trace of Dennis has ever been found, his father died in the belief that his missing son was still alive, somewhere, with someone.</p><p>Discover the full story behind the chilling <a href=#>disappearance of Dennis Martin</a>.</p><p class=.post-content>Learn more about the <a href=#>music</a> used in our podcast.
