The next morning, Felix shows up dead. Shortly after, Oliver and Venetia share an exchange before Venetia is also found to have died by suicide. After overstaying his welcome, Oliver finally leaves Saltburn, only to run into the siblings’ mother, Elspeth, in a cafe years later - following the death of her husband, Sir James.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=8e9f3227f9b1-sltb2023fg01151510still997c>The ending</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8e9f3227f9b1-sltb2023fg01151510still997c.jpg><p>Delighted to see him, Elspeth invites him to Saltburn again but quickly becomes ill and infirm. On her deathbed, Oliver finally reveals his nefarious plan to her. He was never in love with Felix as insinuated, just obsessed with his life.&nbsp;</p><p>He purposefully orchestrated their first meeting, including puncturing Felix’s bike and lending him his own, making Felix feel indebted to him, and poisoning him on the night of his birthday in the maze. He also likely killed Venetia, and arranged his chance encounter with Elspeth in the cafe. While struggling with her health, he also arranges for Elspeth to leave everything to him in her will, making him the owner of Saltburn.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=a78429d8c4c4-vlcsnap-2024-01-04-13h31m24s043>The Saltburn foreshadowing moments you might have missed&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a78429d8c4c4-vlcsnap-2024-01-04-13h31m24s043.png><p>During breakfast, Venetia tells a story about how Percy Shelley’s housekeeper saw him pass by her window and give her a wave, and she waved back before she realised that Percy wasn’t there at all, but in Italy on holiday. A few hours later, he drowned in a boating accident. While telling the story, Felix - who is present at the breakfast table - can be seen walking past the window, foreshadowing his death.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=15f9905e5d1c-sltb2024ut220901jamchi08830r>Oliver’s 'dad' stone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/15f9905e5d1c-sltb2024ut220901jamchi08830r.jpg><p>After Oliver claims that his dad has died, Felix includes him in the family tradition of writing the name of a lost loved one on a stone and throwing it into a river. However, Oliver’s stone gets stuck in the banks, which bodes well as his father is still very much alive.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=b8a0705bee64-sltb2024ut220808jamchi04013r1>Common People</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b8a0705bee64-sltb2024ut220808jamchi04013r1.jpg><p>In a comedic moment, Elspeth tells her children, and Oliver, about how people thought Pulp’s single Common People&nbsp;was about her. The song tells the story of someone who wants to pretend that they are poor when they’re wealthy, a lot like Oliver himself.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=f8b68bdc499d-sltb2023fg00355502still613r1>Venetia over-pouring her red wine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f8b68bdc499d-sltb2023fg00355502still613r1.jpg><p>After Felix’s death, Venetia pours her wine while trying to contain herself, failing as she over-pours and it spills over the table. Later, she is found dead in the bath with the bloody water overflowing in a very similar way.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=306135d56430-firstlook-sltb2023fg01050023still941r>The mirrors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/306135d56430-firstlook-sltb2023fg01050023still941r.jpg><p>Not only does Oliver’s reflection often differ from his own, hinting that he is presenting a completely different version of himself on the outside to what is inside, but after Oliver smashes the mirror in his bathroom in a rage, the next day it is perfectly fixed without a word said about it to anyone, hinting at how the family are keen to gloss over anything imperfect and how they were willing to look the other way regarding Oliver.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=9a95c03e7742-screenshot-2024-01-04-at-132831>The flies caught in paper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a95c03e7742-screenshot-2024-01-04-at-132831.png><p>In a shot of one of the opulent rooms in the house, a stream of fly paper with dead flies stuck to it can be seen over one of the chandeliers, hinting that the family are being caught by Oliver.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uaGltZG18tK3LrZmuqp5isq%2BwyKeeZp6fp7K0tMCdprChnpx6rrvMnqWtq12axbG4wKKlnpxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vivek-ramaswamy-clashes-with-fox-news-host-over-naive-ukraine-stance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vivek Ramaswamy clashes with Fox News host over 'naive' Ukraine stance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kimberly-roads.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kimberly Roads Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
