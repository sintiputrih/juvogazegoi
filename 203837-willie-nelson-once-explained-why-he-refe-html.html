The couple got married in 1991 and shared two children, Lukas and Micah, who are also musicians. Speaking about his marriage to D'Angelo, the country <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/musician/willie-nelson>music legend wrote:</a></p><p class=dh>"It's love that brought Annie and me together, and it's love that, nearly 30 years later, has kept us together."</p><p class=dh>The couple met when D'Angelo was hired to work as a makeup artist on the set of the 1986 movie "Stagecoach," which starred Nelson. After dating for several years, they eventually tied the knot on September 16, 1991, at Nashville's St. Alouin Church, in front of family and friends.</p><p class=dh>Willie Nelson's wife Annie has been <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/04/annie-dangelo-willie-nelson-wife/>instrumental to the star's new</a> stable lifestyle, having stuck by her husband through several drug arrests and charges over the years.</p><p class=dh>The couple shares a unique bond, and Nelson, who admits that he is a difficult person to live with, says it takes someone special to live with him.</p><p class=dh>The couple genuinely has an exceptional understanding.
