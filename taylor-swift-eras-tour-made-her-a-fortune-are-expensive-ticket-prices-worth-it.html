Just how much are some of these tickets?</p><p>According to Music In Minnesota, tickets were supposed to be in the range of $49 and $449. But once fans went onto Ticketmaster, they saw prices that were much higher. The website reported that bots began buying the tickets and then putting them on other websites such as StubHub.
