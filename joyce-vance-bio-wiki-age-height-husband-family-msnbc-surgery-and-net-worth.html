Can you talk about him?</strong></p><p>You know, it was really hard for my husband. He loved his daddy so much. We were close to his parents. We used to spend Sunday nights eating dinner with them and spent a lot of time with them. I always remember that when my mother-in-law was in surgery and was intubated when she could finally speak she looked up at my husband and the first thing she said was: “I’m sorry about your daddy.”</p><p><strong>Your mother-in-law and your father-in-law obviously victims of the crime, but you and Bob as well.</strong></p><p>So, I was unexpectedly pregnant with our first child, just a couple of weeks pregnant when Bob’s dad was killed and I went to visit my mother-in-law in the hospital. She had had extensive surgery, still had some nails in her body. They stayed in her body for the rest of her life. And she, you know, was exactly what you would expect.</p><p>She was depressed, she was sad, she was down, and I told her that I was pregnant, and she was, you know, she was happy, she wasn’t exuberant, but she was happy, and I came back to see her again later that afternoon, and she there was no one in her hospital room.</p><p>And I was frantically worried because her injuries were serious, and so I went flying out to the nurse’s station and asked where she was, and they sort of laughed a little bit and they said you know after you left she got out of bed–she had not gotten out of bed at all before then, and she got up, and she said: “I’ve got to get ready, I’ve got to go home I have a grandbaby coming,” and that I think, you know, by the grace of God, was what helped her recover initially.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joyce-vance-and-barbara-mcquade></span><span>Joyce Vance and Barbara Mcquade</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Professors, as well as former federal prosecutors Barbara McQuade and Joyce White Vance, refute Rep.

You’ve talked about your knitting community. Time to give a shout-out to your knitting community.</strong></p><p>“Knitters are really wonderful people. So, here’s something interesting that I learned, Chuck: a lot of appellate lawyers at DOJ and in the state system are knitters. And so, knitters go on retreats like other people with similar interests do, and I would hang out with other knitters who are appellate lawyers inevitably.</p><p>But knitting is wonderful. There’s nothing like knitting to make the time that you’re waiting between when the jury gets your case, and when they return a verdict, tolerable. I was always a bad waiter when one of my juries was deliberating on a verdict and knitting helps.”</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-joyce-vance></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Joyce Vance</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-joyce-vance></span>Who is Joyce Vance?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Joyce is a famous lawyer.
