The first of which is to come back to guest co-host, an offer that never materializes, and the second is asking them to co-star with her in the long-awaited <a href=#>Sister Act 3</a>. Goldberg has been struggling to make Sister Act 3 happen for years, and when Disney finally gave the project the go in 2021 with <a href=#>Tyler Perry</a> as a producer, she wasted no time assembling a cast. Using her day job at The View as an open casting call, Goldberg brilliantly circumvents agents and managers by putting actors right on the spot in front of an audience. Anything that has to be done to make this movie happen — after all, what a waste it would be to miss out on a title like Sister Act 3: Breaking the Habit. Let’s look back at the many people who Goldberg has already asked to appear in this (hopefully) upcoming film, from Pope Francis to JoJo Siwa.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwmssw0h000b3b8756ig32lb@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Daisy Ridley</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwmstd76000p3b87wbgm8bc3@published data-word-count=89>As Daisy Ridley took her seat for her May 25, 2024 appearance on The View, she giddily told Goldberg, “I’m a really big fan.” In turn, Goldberg responded by saying, “I know you’re an extraordinary singer, maybe we should talk about 3. But we’ll do that another time.” The sheer power of being able to refer to Sister Act 3 as simply 3, and still have a gobsmacked Ridley know exactly what she’s talking about. Most talk shows only give the guests a mug, The View gives them gigs.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw3vn5e7000t3b806muhn557@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Pope Francis</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3vo1j200173b80jfhw5kij@published data-word-count=75>While appearing on The Tonight Show in May of 2024, Goldberg revealed to Jimmy Fallon that during her recent meeting with the pope (who she says seemed to be a fan of Sister Act), she offered him a cameo in the upcoming sequel. “He said he’d see what his time was like,” Goldberg joked. The offer seems like a smart move, given that it might take an act of God to make this movie happen.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw3w56yx00273b807vxi9220@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Sheryl Lee Ralph</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3w5icy002k3b80yy7r1kaa@published data-word-count=57>In February of 2024, Goldberg reunited with <a href=#>Sheryl Lee Ralph</a>, who played the mother of Lauryn Hill’s character in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, and surprised her with an offer to return to the franchise. “We’re in the process of putting together 3, will you come be part of it? Whatever it is?” she asked.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw3vo4z1001e3b80neahuefm@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Jimmy Fallon</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3vzu7u001t3b80w37aci5y@published data-word-count=71>Back when Jimmy Fallon appeared on The View in March of 2023, Goldberg doubled down on an offer she had extended to him. “You still gonna come and do Sister Act?” she asked, with the late night host confirming by telling Goldberg, “Whatever I can do to help, I will do a cameo, I will pop my head through a window and wave, I’ll do whatever you need me to do.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3w26hx00203b80zm0egcns@published data-word-count=60>That conversation got the table thinking, with Joy Behar chiming in to suggest that all of the panelists join the fun. “We could all be nuns also, you know,” she said, with Alyssa Farah Griffin adding, “I’ve been pitching this.” Goldberg didn’t seem quite as receptive to this idea, but conceded that it’s technically a possibility, saying, “Yeah we could.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw3ws3xo003k3b80moeix06j@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Maggie Smith</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3wsfga00443b802smypz3n@published data-word-count=112>While appearing on Loose Women in January of 2023, Goldberg delivered a public plea down the barrel of the camera directly to her Sister Act co-star Dame Maggie Smith. “One of the things that I want to make sure I do while I’m here is I want to let Maggie Smith know, that I’m holding the part of Mother Superior for you, because I just can’t do it with anybody but you,” she said. “So if you need me to come over here and shoot it and do whatever we have to do, we will do whatever you want us to do. Because we don’t want to do it without you, Maggie.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw3wyzeb004c3b808ggsxuyg@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Lizzo and Nicki Minaj</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3wzaam004r3b808nb295t1@published data-word-count=63>In October of 2022, during an appearance on Hell of a Week with Charlamagne Tha God, Goldberg teased her dream cast for the project. “I want everybody to come in, I want Lizzo to come in, I want everybody. I want the girl with the chest, what’s her name?” she asked, before remembering Nicki Minaj’s name, “Nicki! I want Nicki to come in.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw3zkrbd006n3b806tt7elg7@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Kathy Najimy…maybe?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3zlrde007a3b805jn0fi64@published data-word-count=78>When Kathy Najimy, who played Sister Mary Patrick in the original films, came to the table to promote Hocus Pocus 2, she asked about the status of the third movie. Goldberg told her that it was in fact happening, but came short of extending a formal invitation. Perhaps Najimy’s return simply goes without saying! Nonetheless, Goldberg did credit the return of Hocus Pocus with inspiring Disney to let Sister Act’s nuns get back in the habit as well.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw3wdd00002y3b80a3tkcum5@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Jenifer Lewis</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3wdrbx003c3b80uy5753xt@published data-word-count=56>Before Jenifer Lewis’s interview on The View in September of 2022 even got started, Goldberg told her, “You know, we’re still gonna do that movie, you know that, going back,” before reminding the audience, “You know, she’s in Sister Act.” Lewis appeared in both Sister Act films as Michelle, one of Deloris Van Cartier’s background singers.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw3zdbun005s3b80utvkjnil@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>JoJo Siwa</span></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>obsessed with whoopi using the view to cast sister act 3 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mA0WDKBxAF</a></p>— Déjà The View (@dejatheviewpod) <a href=#>November 23, 2021</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw3zedyy006f3b80w6k619qd@published data-word-count=36>Alright, this one certainly wasn’t a formal offer, but Goldberg made a point to let JoJo Siwa know back in 2021 that casting was underway.

Any job. I mean, you ain’t got to say nothing now, you know, I’ll send you an email or something. Just let me know if you need me.” But as it turns out, great minds think alike. “I already brought it up,” Goldberg responded, which sounds like she’s definitely in the mix, and thank god for that. Forget the pope, Keke Palmer is the most important addition to this franchise!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwmt0jx6000y3b87bl5aib3k@published data-word-count=5>This post has been updated.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl981gyxb0000wleiu61dnz4x@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Whoopi Goldberg Already Has Some Sisters in Mind for Sister Act 3</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clhkwyv9q002h0jfjv7psxk3i@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Sheryl Lee Ralph Answers Every Question We Have About Sister Act 2</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clhz6xtau00000ibhpmixm8hh@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Whoopi Goldberg Gave Sunny Hostin a Lap Dance on The View</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Everyone Who Whoopi Goldberg Has Asked to Be in Sister Act 3</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnymwsSrsKimlWLEqbvOqaBmn5%2BhsaOx0aBkmqubmrFuv8isq56qXZawtXmSZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./expendables-2-leads-weak-box-office-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Expendables 2 Leads Box Office</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-dre-net-worth-140725.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Dre Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
