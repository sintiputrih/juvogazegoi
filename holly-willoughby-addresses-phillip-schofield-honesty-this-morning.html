She’s not shying away from the tricky subject as she wants to show up for the viewers and loyal fans.</p><p>“Even though Holly has been <a href=#>on holiday with her family</a>, she has been thinking about it a lot and tried to process the dramatic turn of events.</p><p>“She has thought about what she will say and written it in advance, taking her time to get the words right. It’s not something she’s being forced to do.</p><p>“It won’t be an easy moment for her, and she knows she could get emotional, but she thinks it’s the right thing to do and wants to speak about it in an honest way.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>“It will happen at the very beginning of Monday’s show.</p><p>“Holly was really upset to hear that Phil <a href=#>was feeling suicidal</a> amid the backlash since the scandal and doesn’t want him to be in any pain, so she will choose her words carefully and deliver them in a sensitive manner.”</p><p>Holly will be joined on the sofa on Monday by co-host Josie Gibson.</p><p>After her speech she will then focus on light entertainment topics.</p><p>She will interview Queen singer Adam Lambert to celebrate Pride month and the <a href=#>LGBT community</a>.</p><p>Staff have removed pictures of Phillip from the ITV corridors to signify a new era — but not as a snub to him, it is claimed.</p><p>In another move, phone-ins involving the public will be heavily vetted by production staff to filter out any attempted viewer outbursts over the scandal.</p><p>And interaction segments where viewers send in pictures and social media posts are being paused to avoid the risk of any abuse being targeted at the presenters.</p><p>Phillip told The Sun Holly <a href=#>did not know about his affair</a>.</p><p>He said: “I’ve lost my best friend.

She wants to put her best foot forward and help be a part of the shift backstage, where everyone is happy.</p><p>“Obviously, the reports of on-set toxicity have been upsetting to hear and Holly hopes this is the start of new era for the show and that they can pull together.</p><p>“Producers are hopeful Holly will now steer the ship towards calmer waters for the next six weeks before her summer break.”</p><p>Our source said when Holly is off for the summer, “bigger decisions will be made about a rebrand of the show, with new credits and a soundtrack to signify the new era — and distance itself from Phil’s reign”.</p><p>Last week, Phillip said <a href=#>he texted Holly</a> as the affair story broke, writing: “I know you can’t reply, you’re probably not allowed, but please know I’m desperately sorry.”</p><p>Our source said Holly has still not made contact with Phillip, but is saddened that he has been suffering with his mental health.</p><p>They added: “Holly hasn’t engaged with Phil, but is upset he has been feeling so low.”</p><p>Holly has not commented since<a href=#> taking to social media</a> last weekend to reveal Phillip had lied to her about his affair.</p><p>She wrote last Saturday: “It’s taken time to process yesterday’s news. When reports of this relationship first surfaced, I asked Phil directly if this was true and was told it was not. It’s been very hurtful to now find out this was a lie.”</p><p>On Friday’s This Morning, <a href=#>Alison broke down in tears</a> as she discussed The Sun’s exclusive interview with Phillip, in which he spoke of feeling suicidal.</p><p>She said she feared he could only take so much.</p><p>Alison, who has worked on the show with Phillip for more than two decades, was struggling when it came to the newspaper review.</p><p>For days, This Morning had ignored the fall-out of Phillip’s admission about his affair, despite the story being splashed across The Sun’s front pages.</p><p>But on Friday, &nbsp;presenters took time to discuss his <a href=#>exclusive interview with The Sun</a>.</p><p>Alison appeared alongside co-presenter Dermot when she admitted she was finding the scandal difficult to process.</p><p>Dermot told viewers: “It’s very difficult for us to cover this story because he’s a friend and a colleague.”</p><p>Tearful Alison continued: “I’m just finding it really painful because obviously I loved Phillip Schofield and it’s weird because I still love Phillip Schofield.</p><p>“However what he has done is wrong. He’s admitted it. He’s said sorry but, as a family, we’re all really struggling to process.”</p><p>She later admitted she feared for Phillip’s <a href=#>mental health</a>, adding: “There is so much a man can take isn’t there?
