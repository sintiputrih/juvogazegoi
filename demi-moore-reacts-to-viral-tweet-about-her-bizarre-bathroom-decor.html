The photo shows Moore sitting on a patterned couch in her bathroom, which was also covered in brown carpeting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore-Reacts-to-Viral-Tweet-About-Her-Bizarre-Bathroom-Decor.jpg><p>“Starting a Slack channel for the sole purpose us discussing why Demi Moore has both carpet and a couch in her bathroom,” Twitter user <a href=#><strong>Alexis Wilson</strong></a> (@sassyblackdiva) wrote on Thursday <a href=#>alongside more photos</a> of the inside of the G.I. Jane star’s home. “Trying to put together the pieces before I pivot to Demi Moore interior design stan account full time.”</p><p>While some social media users were appalled by the wall-to-wall carpet and furniture in the actress’ makeshift office, others took it as <a href=#>interior design inspiration</a>. “Honestly??? Genius in the way that now it’s a shorter distance to lay on that couch in your towel for hours instead of walking all the way to your bed to do the same thing,” one reply read.</p><p>Another fan felt betrayed by never having been informed about this aspect of Moore’s life before. “There wasn’t a chapter about this in her memoir and I feel disturbed,” they <a href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><p>Three days later, Moore discovered the series of inquisitive tweets — and couldn’t contain her laughter. “This thread has our whole family howling!” she responded on Saturday, July 11. Her daughters <a href=#><strong>Rumer</strong></a>, 31, and <a href=#><strong>Tallulah</strong></a>, 26, also got in on the “hilarious observations” about their mom’s decorating skills, with the former tweeting, “Thank you Alexis for this magic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Moore-Reacts-to-Viral-Tweet-About-Her-Bizarre-Bathroom-Decor-Promo.jpg><p>Us Weekly confirmed earlier this year that Moore was <a href=#>quarantined with ex-husband <strong>Bruce Willis</strong></a> and their daughters, Rumer, Tallulah, and <a href=#><strong>Scout</strong></a>, 28, and in Idaho amid the global health crisis. The Die Hard actor, 65, and the New Mexico native were married from 1987 to 2000, but have still kept a close friendship in the wake of their split.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s a funny thing to say, but I’m very proud of our divorce,” Moore wrote in her memoir, <a href=#>Inside Out</a>. “It wasn’t easy at first, but we managed to move the heart of our relationship, the heart of what created our family, into something new that <a href=#>gave the girls a loving, supportive environment</a> with both parents. We felt more connected than we did before the divorce.”</p><p>While hunkered down during the pandemic, the family soaked up every bit of free time together and was later joined by Willis’ wife, <a href=#><strong>Emma Heming</strong></a>, and their <a href=#>two daughters</a>, Mabel, 8, and Evelyn, 6. Though Moore felt lucky to be spending this uncertain time with her loved ones, she admitted that some days in quarantine are more challenging than others.</p><p>“It’s OK to feel scared,” she <a href=#>said in a video</a> posted to her family’s ShopWyllis Instagram in April. “That’s pretty normal, and we’re not alone. You’re not alone to feel that way. … We each have our own journey, and we don’t know what that is for someone else.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZ2eeq67zqucZqqVlrC1v4ytpmaumaeurXnTsJyerF2Wr7DB02afnqpdl7a7rdGrnGaakam1s7vOpmSdnZOkv3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./285191-gloria-vanderbilt-who-was-taken-her-moth-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gloria Vanderbilt, Who Was Taken from Her Mother at a Young Age, Later Cut Her from Her Multi-Millio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./spices.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chipotle Apple Sweet Potato Salad</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
