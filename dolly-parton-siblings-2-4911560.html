The legendary <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>singer/songwriter</a> shared the “frenetic backstage story and delightful on-camera results of her desire to uplift an exhausted world’s spirits by sharing the unique ‘mountain magic’ she has always found in and around Dollywood at Christmas.”&nbsp; The show included some of Dolly’s favorite songs, plus a few Christmas classics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dolly-parton-rachel-parton-sibling-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Of course, the holidays are all about family, something the East Tennessee native knows without a doubt as she is the fourth of 12 children! Dolly was raised by her two parents, <strong>Avie Lee Caroline</strong> and <strong>Robert Lee Parton Sr.</strong>, in a one-room cabin with 11 siblings! “It was crowded!” Dolly told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a> in 2016. “With that many brothers and sisters there was plenty of teasing and fighting but we were all in it together.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although the family struggled financially, Dolly said they always made the best of it.&nbsp;“We were poor but I never felt poor,” she explained to the outlet. “We always had food, a roof over our heads and clothes on our backs. It wasn’t exactly what we wanted but Mama and Daddy were always quick to point out the families that suffered far more than we ever did. It all seemed just natural to me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Dolly went on to a successful recording career, leaving the family home after high school to chase her dreams. While her siblings may not have made a big of a name for themselves as their sister, Dolly has said that they were all very talented. “There’s 12 of us kids, six girls and six boys, and we all sing and write and play,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NPR </a>in 2010. “It’s just that I think I’ve taken it farther. I don’t know that I’m near as good as some of the others, but I’ve been more willing to sacrifice and work a little harder than some of the others might have been willing, you know, to do just because they wanted to have a family and do other things. But there’s a lot of talent in this family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Keep reading to find out more about Dolly’s talented siblings (in order from eldest to youngest), below.</p><h2>Willadeene</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dolly-parton-Willadeene-parton-sibling-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Willadeene</strong> recorded a gospel album with her sisters <strong>Stella</strong> and <strong>Cassie</strong> before switching lanes and becoming an author.
