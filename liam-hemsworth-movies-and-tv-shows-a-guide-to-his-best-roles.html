If you’re a fan of excellent acting, these Liam Hemsworth movies and TV shows should make your watchlist. They highlight his talent and versatility.</p><p>Born in Melbourne, Australia, on January 13, 1990, Liam Hemsworth is the youngest of the Hemsworth brothers. His brothers, Chris Hemsworth and Luke Hemsworth preceded him into the entertainment scene.</p><p>This promising actor first graced the screen when he was 17 in the Australian soap opera “Neighbours” as Josh Taylor. This initial role ignited a successful career that soon expanded into an impressive filmography.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-03_06-52-18-fotor-2023080365546-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liam_Hemsworth_Movies_and_TV_Shows></span>Liam Hemsworth Movies and TV Shows<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Liam Hemsworth’s movie career sharply turned towards international recognition when he moved to the United States after his TV debut. The Australian-born actor landed minor roles in 2009’s “Knowing” and “Triangle,” sharing the screen with notable actors like Nicholas Cage and Melissa George.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his breakthrough came with his charming portrayal of Will Blakelee in “The Last Song,” the love interest of Veronica “Ronnie” Miller. Afterwards, he landed roles in films that ranged from big-budget action blockbusters to independent dramas, each showcasing his versatility. In addition, his physicality and comedic talent makes him an ideal fit for various roles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liam_Hemsworth_Movies_and_TV_Shows_You_Need_To_See></span>Liam Hemsworth Movies and TV Shows You Need To See<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Here’s a list of some of the Liam Hemsworth movies that should make your watchlist:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Hunger_Games_2012></span>The Hunger Games (2012)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“The Hunger Games” franchise, which propelled co-star Jennifer Lawrence to stardom, also significantly cemented Hemsworth’s career. Despite being a supporting role, his performance as Gale Hawthorne added depth to the blockbuster and catapulted him further into the limelight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-03_06-52-12-fotor-2023080365320.jpg><p>Although the franchise primarily aims at a younger audience, there are enough thrills and narrative intrigue that appeal to an older demographic. The first part kicked off with a relatively light tone. However, the sequels came with a twist, gradually raising the stakes and increasing the tension.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Killerman_2018></span>Killerman (2018)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As Moe in “Killerman,” Hemsworth took on a grittier role, delivering a challenging and sympathetic performance. While Liam Hemsworth movies and TV shows sometimes have a cliche storyline, this film has captivated many fans. “Killerman” has a killer entry into the crime-drama genre and delivers on its title.</p><p>Although the film starts in a pretty straightforward, even predictable fashion, it introduces plenty of clever twists and turns that keep you guessing. While the storyline is excellent, Liam Hemsworth’s stellar performance in the movie is noteworthy. Also, the intricate character moments between Hemsworth and his co-star Emory Cohen are one for the books.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Isnt_It_Romantic_2019></span>Isn’t It Romantic (2019)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>One of Liam Hemsworth’s movies that should make your watchlist in this romantic comedy. In this movie, Hemsworth took on the role of a billionaire client, Blake. “Isn’t It Romantic” revolves around Natalie, a young lady who hates romantic comedies but finds herself in an altered reality where she’s the leading lady in her romantic comedy – including the attention of the hunky Blake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-03_06-51-36-fotor-2023080365424-683x1024.jpg><p>Cliches and minor quibbles aside, the film serves up plenty of hilarious gags, tender moments, and a thoughtful message about the importance of self-love before pursuing the love of others. In addition, Hemsworth’s role in the romantic comedy adds some nice twists and turns clever enough to gloss over the cliches it aims at.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Poker_Face_2022></span>Poker Face (2022)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“Poker Face” allowed Hemsworth to display his acting versatility. Playing the cynical Mikey under the direction of Russell Crowe, Hemsworth convincingly portrayed a character older than his actual age. Like most Liam Hemsworth movies and TV shows, “Poker Face” really put his talents to the test.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the famous Australian-born actor’s stellar acting skills, too many things are going on at once. The film tries to be a character-driven drama, a crime thriller, and an action flick. Hence, it has a few plot holes and lapses in logic. Still, Crowe builds the suspense nicely, and the actors have great chemistry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liam_Hemsworth_TV_Shows_From_Australian_Soaps_to_American_Series></span>Liam Hemsworth TV Shows: From Australian Soaps to American Series<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After making his TV debut in “Neighbors,” Hemsworth went on to star in other TV shows like “Macleod’s Daughters” and “The Elephant Princess.” Although he has appeared in several TV shows, his more recent appearances in “Most Dangerous Game” (2020) and “Workaholics” (2016) further enriched the list of Liam Hemsworth’s movies and TV shows.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liam_Hemsworths_Filmography></span>Liam Hemsworth’s Filmography<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Liam Hemsworth’s filmography includes nineteen films and eight TV shows. Despite being the brother of “Thor” star <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a> and known for his marriage to pop star Miley Cyrus, he has forged his path in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Liam Hemsworth will undoubtedly continue to take on more movies and TV shows that showcase his talent and versatility. Like actress <a href=#>Tea Leoni’s movies and TV shows</a>, Hemsworth’s performances continually captivate audiences and contribute to his growing legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuaqtzGafnqWjrLyzwMdmpKiumZrAbq3NnWStrl2otbDD0maYZp%2BlnrGmedOoZKGho2Kvpr%2FTZqmopJWofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./riz-ahmed-the-long-goodbye-review-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Performing for Ghosts: Riz Ahmeds The Long Goodbye</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashians-plant-based-meals-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashians Plant-Based Meals: Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
