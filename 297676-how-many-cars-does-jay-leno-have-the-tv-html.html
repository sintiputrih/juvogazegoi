He has so many vehicles that a show was dedicated to showcasing them.</p><p class=dh>James Douglas Muir Leno is one of the wealthiest celebrities on television. He began as a stand-up comedian in a career of over four decades. His most notable works include hosting "The Tonight's Show with Jay Leno Show" from 1992 to 2014 and "Jay Leno's Garage" since 2014.</p><p class=dh>Leno's collection is approximated to be above 180 cars. Among his collection are a wide variety of high-end sports cars, luxurious vehicles, general road cars, and vintage cars going as far back as the 1900s. One of his oldest models, a Stanley Steamer Vanderbilt Cup Racer, was made in 1906.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f918982d499c5e41dad47315a13687f5.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jay Leno at the Petersen Automotive Museum Gala at The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California on October 5, 2018 | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>The Exact Amount of Cars in Jay Leno's Garage Might Be Impossible to Confirm</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>One sure thing is that Jay Leno has a lot of cars. He ranks in the top 10 of the world's most prominent car collectors in a list with some influential people. Although the exact number of his cars is unknown, there is a consensus that it is above 180. The Daily Mail put that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8048049/Jay-Leno-got-car-wanted-naked-pics-girlfriend.html>number</a> at 189 in February 2020.</p><p class=dh>Although that number is large, it does not even consider the total number of his vehicles when including motorbikes — Leno owns over 100 bikes. The story of how he got his love for cars is fascinating and hilarious. The talk show host said he got his first car to take naked photos of his girlfriend, which was typical in those days.</p><p class=dh>He said that in his youth, because the technology to send nude pictures was not yet available, the only way one could get those was to drive to a girl's house, hence, the need for a car. His <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/jay-leno-cars>first car</a> was a dumped Renault that he and his friends used to break and repair, and in the process, he got hooked on cars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f83766057284e9f5e274ff571849e1b0.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jay Leno rides a 1964 Zweirad Union Kavalier Type 115 motorcycle during the 2014 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach, California on August 17, 2014 | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Interesting Examples from Jay Leno's Car Collection</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Cars in <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/jay-leno-cars>Jay Leno's collection</a> date as far back as the early 20th century. Among his prized possession is a 1924 Bentley Twin Turbo. The vehicle's primary purpose was to be a race car, but when Leno drove it initially, he felt it lacked power. He and his team of mechanics got to work and changed it to an eight-liter engine.</p><p class=dh>Spectacular and stylish are some of the many words that describe his 1934 Rolls-Royce Merlin. The all-black vehicle has a certain elegance that cannot be seen in too many other vehicles, and with its V12 engine, it is no wonder a car enthusiast like Leno would have it in his garage.</p><p class=dh>One of Leno's extraordinary cars is a 1965 Daimler Ferret Mark ⅔ Scout. The car is a mini tank designed for military use. With a top speed of just 58mph, it is one of the slowest cars in his collection but probably the strongest and meanest. The comedian even joked that the car was perfect for LA's pothole-ridden streets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/8f21ed95ff8378bf3ec7027493f47dd4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jay Leno drives away in his vintage collector red fire engine, after the show on April 16, 2007 | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Jay Leno's Story about Buying a Special Car from a 94-Year-Old Woman</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Among Leno's collection of cars is a yellow 1954 Hudson Hornet. Animated movie lovers may remember the name Hudson Hornet from the hit film "Cars" by Walt Disney Pictures. The classic caught his attention after the lady invited him to look at it. He recalled the old lady <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8048049/Jay-Leno-got-car-wanted-naked-pics-girlfriend.html>saying</a>:</p><p class=dh>''Oh I've got a '51 Hudson. Will you come and look at mine, my husband and I bought it new in '51. We drove it from New Jersey to California, he died in '96, it's the only car we ever owned, it's in the driveway with four flat tires.''</p><p class=dh>Leno purchased the car and finished restoring it two years later. He then invited the former owner to ride in the newly remodeled car. She accepted the invitation and chose to take her two children with her. On their road trip, Leno was captivated by how the 94-year-old woman and her kids enjoyed the experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9f5f3940efb40412a576f51f372e1fd9.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jay Leno arrives at the "The Tonight Show" studios in Burbank in a Hudson Hornet on January 28, 2014 | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Jay Leno's Favorite Car</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>For some, it might be hard to choose a favorite, especially when there are over 180 choices. That is the case with Leno, who is unsure of which one to pick. However, he does have favorites in specific categories of cars. For example, when it comes to modern vehicles, his choice is the McLaren F1.</p><p class=dh>One thing that sets Leno apart from other prominent car collectors is that his cars are not just for show. The entertainer takes time to drive his cars and even modifies them when he feels like he's not getting the best out of the vehicle. For him, working on the cars, either by driving or fixing them, is the best. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8048049/Jay-Leno-got-car-wanted-naked-pics-girlfriend.html>explained</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I wouldn't have all these cars if I had a favorite. I just like the mechanicalness of driving. I'm in a business where you make your living by talking. I think the heart is healthiest when the head and the hands work together.

He was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/14/jay-leno-burn-face-car-los-angeles>burnt</a> on the left side of his body, primarily his face and hand. The TV personality was treated for the burns at a hospital.</p><p class=dh>Luckily, the injuries were not severe, and he is set to recover quickly. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/14/jay-leno-burn-face-car-los-angeles>said</a>, "I got serious burns from a gasoline fire. I am OK. Just need a week or two to get back on my feet."</p><p class=dh>The setback for the 72-year-old has not dumped his morale too much, and he will be sure to get back to his favorite hobby in no time. For him, it is probably one of those things that come with the job.</p><p class=dh>The car enthusiast is highly passionate about his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.youtube.com/c/jaylenosgarage/about>car collection</a> and has not looked back since his younger years.
