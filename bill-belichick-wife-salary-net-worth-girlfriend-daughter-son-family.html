His parents are Jeannette Munn and Steve Belichick, a former assistant coach at the US Naval Academy.</p><p>Aside from his natural talent, Bill got the morale and technicalities he needed to be successful in the business of football from people like his sporty father.

Bill Belichick did not just play football during his varsity days, he also did well in lacrosse and squash.</p><p>Straight out of the University, he landed his first paying job as the assistant to coach Ted Marchiibroda, the then head coach of Baltimore Colt in 1975. He was later hired by Detroit Lions where he spent 2 years and worked as their assistant special team’s coach before moving to Denver Broncos in 1978 where he spent just a season.</p><p>He joined York Giants for 12 years serving as the Team’s defensive assistant and special teams coach.
