When you are too tired to even think about fixing dinner, this is what you whip up.&nbsp; I have heard that many chefs during cooking school or after a long shift on the line, they come home and make Spaghetti Aglio e Olio.

Years ago I flew to Chicago to bake with Nestle for their “Bake Some Good” event. We baked goodies and then delivered them to a large homeless shelter in the area. It will go down as one of the best days of my life!</p><p>It was a whirlwind trip and I arrived the night before the event. Since I had never been to Chicago, I couldn’t wait to venture out into the city.&nbsp;I started to walk the streets and I stumbled upon Eataly, a culinary mecca that I am obsessed with in New York City, and I found it in Chicago. This is what foodies like me dream about.&nbsp; If you’ve never been to Eataly, put it on your list.</p><p>It is a two-story foodie paradise filled with all kinds of restaurants, bakeries, and you can even pick up your fresh produce while eating gelato.&nbsp; I could spend an entire day there just eating my way through it! I found an area with cookbooks lined up the wall which is my kind of reading.&nbsp; Then I found a large sign stating, “50% off all cookbooks.” Are you kidding me? I just hit the jackpot! Well, except for the fact that I had ZERO room in my suitcase. This didn’t stop me! I am one resourceful girl and there had to be a way.</p><p>I thumbed through stacks and stacks of cookbooks while I devoured some desserts.&nbsp; That’s my kind of multi-tasking.&nbsp; I made the trek back to the hotel holding several heavy cookbooks. One was Lidia’s Italian-American Kitchen, which has authentic Italian recipes. If only there was a hidden camera in my hotel room that night as I tried to stuff everything into one little carry-on.&nbsp; I basically wore about 4 outfits on the plane. I kid you not. But the cookbooks and a ridiculous amount of Nestle chocolate I had to carry back home were definitely worth it!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spaghetti-Aglio-e-Olio-5.jpg alt="Spaghetti Aglio e Olio.

A touch of freshly grated parmesan cheese can be sprinkled on the top.</p><p>Sometimes I change it up and sautee the garlic with half extra-virgin olive oil and half butter.&nbsp; The butter gives it some extra rich flavor.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spaghetti-Aglio-e-Olio-3.jpg alt="Spaghetti Aglio e Olio.
