They said they rushed him to a hospital, but he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving.</p><p>A medical examiner determined Brooks died of starvation and infection and that the manner of death was homicide.</p><p><a href=#>NBC affiliate WSTM</a> obtained court documents which reportedly show that Brooks’s teachers complained about the boy’s deteriorating health as far back as 2018. Child Protective Services caseworkers reportedly rejected those concerns. For example, a caseworker “demonstrated hostility and annoyance with school staff for making hotline calls” and “said that in such situations, the parents should be given the benefit of the doubt because they are trying as hard as they can,” according to court documents.</p><p>Teachers are <a href=#>mandatory reporters of child abuse</a>&nbsp;under New York State law.</p><p>The reported health issues included sores on the boy’s body, which were apparently caused by the overuse of a wheelchair. There was reportedly a baseball sized sore on the boy’s hip in April 2019; it prompted his school principal to clean his urine-soaked wheelchair. A CPS caseworker reportedly said she could not smell urine on the chair.</p><p>The alleged pattern is that teachers raised repeated concerns about Brooks’s health, but those concerns were not addressed. Brooks appeared to be consistently loosing weight.</p><p>A school aide reportedly said Brooks was having trouble with the remote learning in May 2020. The aide also noted several instances where Brooks cried during online calls and appeared to have trouble supporting his own head. Again, CPS workers were told about these incidents, including Brooks’s apparent trouble swallowing and his lack of medical attention.</p><p>A speech therapist on March 9, 2021 reportedly took a picture of Brooks, including a caption expressing concern over marks on his face and dark circles under his eyes.</p><p>An except from documents <a href=#>reported by WSTM</a> reads as follows:</p><p>But CPS said, ‘I don’t know much about Cerebral Palsy but Jordan is happy doing school at home. He has no dark circles under his eyes and the marks on his face is excema [sic], Mom showed me the cream she uses. We will close this case very soon.’</p><p>Two months later, Brooks was dead.</p><p>Onondaga County District Attorney&nbsp;<strong>Bill Fitzpatrick&nbsp;</strong>did not address whether social workers failed to answer the complaints with adequate action.</p><p>“I would caution people not to jump to any conclusions as I have seen nothing to date to suggest the child’s needs were ignored in Onondaga and in fact the complaints were addressed,” he told WSTM.</p><p>A judge reportedly issued a stay-away order involving Lisa’s 14-year-old daughter because prosecutors want to keep the couple from possibly influencing her testimony if she is called as a witness.</p><p>Colin Kalmbacher and Jerry Lambe contributed reporting.</p><p>[Images via Oswego County Sheriff’s Office]</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=72061b0201321e1305131c1611001b1f175c111d1f>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6G2tK2MmqWdZZGjwam7zbJksJmcmb%2BwuoyipWain6exorqMm6mop5uoeqWxwK2faA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-marvin-harrison-jr-s-net-worth-in-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Marvin Harrison Jr.'s Net Worth in 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./asus-k53e-testing-dualcore-sandy-bridge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>LCD, Temperatures, and Noise Levels</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
