The longstanding CBS series may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but its fans have remained largely happy over a full six seasons of the action drama.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Based around both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the 1975 television series and the 2003 film</a> of the same name, the 2017 series has easily surpassed its predecessors to become the most popular version of S.W.A.T. so far. Its headed into its seventh and final season in 2024, leaving fans with one last chance to get their fill of the action-packed series.</p><h2 id=h-s-w-a-t-s-season-7-release-date-and-trailer data-injectable=false>S.W.A.T.’s season 7 release date and trailer</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>S.W.A.T.‘s final chapter is headed to screens sooner than many of its fans expected. The series polished off its penultimate season in May of 2023, following in a trend that’s stayed constant across the show’s run. Previous seasons typically saw the show start between September and November and conclude in May, but the show’s final season is switching things up. Its aiming for a start date much earlier in the year, leaving fans with an unexpectedly quick Feb. 16 release date. That will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">see the show conclude</a> much earlier than usual, after it makes its way through the 13-episode season.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What to expect from the season 7 S.W.A.T. plot</h2><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Quite a bit of the plot in season 7 of S.W.A.T. is still under wraps, but we do know a few vital details about what to expect from the show. We know that the season premiere will take the story over the border and into Mexico, where Hondo and his team are headed to apprehend a suspect.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>Apart from that, details are still scarce. Its all but guaranteed to be well worth a watch for longtime fans of the show, however, as S.W.A.T. gives its viewers one last chance to say goodbye to the longstanding series.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Casting lineup for S.W.A.T. season 7</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S.W.A.T.-cas.jpg><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>Many of the same actors S.W.A.T. fans have come to love across six seasons of content will be making a return for the show’s final season. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Series lead Shemar Moore</a>&nbsp;was always a guarantee — is it even S.W.A.T. without him? — but he’ll be joined by a lineup of people that help make the show what it is.</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>They include series staples like Jay Harrington, returning as David Kay, David Lim as Victor Tan, and Patrick St. Esprit as Robert Hicks. Several other regulars will be returning in recurring roles, stepping back from the leading position they took in previous seasons but tagging along to see the show off. Actors like Alex Russell and Kenny Johnson fall into this camp, and will be joined be several newcomers — or previous favorites who are taking on larger roles, like Anna Enger Ritch and Rochelle Aytes.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where to watch season 7 of S.W.A.T.</h2><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=false>Fans looking to say goodbye to the action drama can do so as the show airs over on CBS — where its slated to drop episodes weekly at 8pm on Friday nights. Or they can wait patiently for the show to arrive on Netflix and Hulu — alongside previous seasons of the show —&nbsp;which will probably take a good few months following its conclusion on CBS. Still, patient fans should see the series arrive on streaming by the Fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0edZmmGasXaiyor%2FOp2RwZaKauaat0p5knZmkmnq1vsCio56qXZiutMCMqaOorF2Wu6V5zKipnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./willis-mcgahees-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Willis McGahees net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rick-hendrick-net-worth-179964.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rick Hendrick Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
