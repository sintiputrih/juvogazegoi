Javiera is the oldest Pascal sibling, and Pedro is the second eldest in the Pascal crew (his birthday is April 2, 1975). Pedro and Javiera were born in Santiago, Chile.</p><p>Lux and Nicolás are Pedro's younger siblings. Career-wise, Nicolás chose a more under-the-radar job than his superstar brother. He is a pediatric neurologist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pedro Pascal accompanied his sister, Javiera Balmaceda, to the 2023 Oscars.</h2><p>As it turns out, Pedro's sister Javiera is also in the entertainment biz!

However, the Pascal siblings were eventually able to take trips back to Chile with their parents once it was safe enough to do so, so they could visit their relatives there.</p><p>The The Last of Us star has never forgotten where he came from.</p><p>Pedro said in his Saturday Night Live monologue that, "[My parents] were so brave, and without them, I wouldn’t be here in this wonderful country,” Pascal said, starting to choke up. “And I certainly wouldn’t be standing here with you all tonight. So, to all my family watching in Chile, I just want to say, te amo, te extraño and deja de dar mi informacíon personal, which means, I love you, I miss you, and stop giving out my phone number.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbKlvs5mp5qrk5a5br%2FIm6Oippeo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zion-williamson-children-does-zion-williamson-have-kids.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zion Williamson Children: Does Zion Williamson Have Kids?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katherine-zhu-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-49108-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Katherine Zhu Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
