The famed American actress, singer, and comedian who was born Carol Creighton Burnett on April 26, 1933, in San Antonio, Texas, United States has completed another year around the sun.</p><p>Throughout her decades-long career in the entertainment industry, Burnett worked hard and paved a path for herself in Hollywood as she came from humble beginnings. Read on to delve deep into the life of the legendary actress Carol Burnett.</p><h3>Carol Burnett’s net worth revealed</h3><p>As of 2023, Carol Burnett has an estimated net worth of $45 million. She is the recipient of six Primetime Emmy awards, a Tony award, a Grammy award, and seven Golden Globe awards.</p><p>Carol’s groundbreaking variety show titled The Carol Burnett Show which premiered in the year 1967 on the channel CBS ran for a total of 279 episodes until 1978. At that time, it was one of the first shows to be hosted by a woman. The talk show aired again in 1991 for nine episodes.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/carol_burnett.jpg alt="tim conway net worth,carol burnett children,carol burnett net worth 2023,julie andrews net worth,cher net worth,carol burnett today,carol burnett age,vicki lawrence net worth,carol burnett net worth,carol burnett net worth 2022,carol burnett net worth 2020,what is carol burnett&amp;#039;s net worth and age,how old is carol burnett net worth,carol burnett bio and net worth,how much is carol burnett worth,carol burnett salary,how much did carol burnett make per episode" width=648 height=365 sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>During an April 2023 interview with Page Six, the Emmy winner said, “I don’t think a network would go for what we did. We had a 28-piece live orchestra, we had 12 dancers, we had two guest stars a week and Bob Mackie designed—get this—60 to 75 costumes a week, everything everybody wore in all the sketches and all the musical numbers, on and on and on.”</p><p>She continued, “And no network today would spend that kind of money. The money that it would cost today would be astronomical. So, they’re not gonna go for it. And they, you know, they feel that variety is dead, which I don’t believe it is. … There are many people who could do a variety show, but … they couldn’t do what we did because of the cost. That’s the problem. That’s why there aren’t any shows like ours or Dean Martin or any of those, you know, just can’t happen today.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u186c9b438816a13d3cb7369504da2251><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Meet Carol Burnett's Three Daughters: Carrie, Jody, and Erin</span></a><h3>All you need to know about Carol Burnett’s early life</h3><p>Carol Creighton Burnett came into the world on April 26, 1933.
