DO NOT move a tiki torch or light that has been ignited. Extinguish it and give it some time to cool before moving it to prevent gasoline spilling and igniting unintentionally while you’re moving. In particular, ethanol gel fuel has the potential to burn with an unseen flame, resulting in an explosion and damage if the container is refilled while the fuel is still burning.
