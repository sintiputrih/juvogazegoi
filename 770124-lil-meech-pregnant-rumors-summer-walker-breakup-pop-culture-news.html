During a recent appearance on The Morning Hustle, the BMF actor opened up about his infamous split from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Summer Walker</a> and revealed where they stand now. He claims that despite their <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">arguably messy breakup</a>, he still has love for her and respects the songstress as an artist.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Me and Summer, we still have love for each other. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">We're both going our separate ways,</a>" he shared. "We don't have no problems with each other. She's an amazing singer and a good person."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-meech-amp-summer-walker-still-have-love-for-each-other>Lil Meech & Summer Walker "Still Have Love" For Each Other</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">His relationship with Summer Walker isn't the only thing Lil Meech addressed during the interview, however. The Detroit-born performer also touched on rumors that a lucky lady in his life is expecting, which he sparked himself late last year. In December, a clip of Meech chatting with friends in the studio started making its rounds online, which shows his response to the question of whether or not he has any children. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"I've got one on the way right now,"</a> he said. "My girl is pregnant."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While this certainly managed to get fans talking, and even theorizing that the mother-to-be was Summer, Meech says he was simply joking. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"I don't know where they got that from,"</a> he explained before being reminded of the clip. "Oh, I think I know what you're talking about," Meech continued. "Yeah, I was playing in that video. They took a video of me playing around and probably made it into something." What do you think of Lil Meech shutting down rumors that his lady is pregnant? What about the actor's praise for Summer Walker?
