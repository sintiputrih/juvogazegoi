Tony Romo is as well-known around the NFL as a player and then broadcaster, but will always be linked to whether he played in the Super Bowl. To give you a full breakdown, we have to go through his story in the NFL from where he came into this league against all odds, paired with how long Romo was starting quarterback for America's Team, and much more.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Romo's Days at Eastern Illinois and His NFL Path</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Anthony "Tony" Romo, born on April 21st in San Diego, California, was going to be passionate about the way he played ball. After not being heavily recruited out of high school, Romo played college football at Eastern Illinois University, an NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision formerly known as Division I-. He was showered with multiple awards at the end of his college career, winning the top player in FCS status via the Walter Payton Award.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His Time as Dallas Cowboys Starting QB</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After excelling at the college level, Romo eventually landed with the Dallas Cowboys, one of the most storied franchises in professional football. The Cowboys signed Romo in 2003 as an undrafted free agent, and he went on to a career that ultimately saw him become one of the most significant figures in franchise history. Romo, the starting quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys from 2006 to 2016, is known for his leadership on and off the field, along with some play-making toughness.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Important Games, Regular Seasons, and Playoff Years of His Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During his NFL career, Romo played a key role in guiding the Cowboys to some memorable wins and postseason appearances. The most prominent was the 2009 season when Romo helped lead his team to a playoff appearance, largely thanks to another strong year from him. For eight years, he was an absolute superstar, overcoming injury and bad breaks in some seasons.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The tenacious, prodigious heart of Tony Romo's NFL career with this page-turning tale within the constructs of the NFL. While his lack of a Super Bowl appearance is one part of his career that must be mentioned, it's also impossible to argue with the permanent mark he leaves behind as such </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>an important</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> quarterback and person in league history. In the end, Romo's journey stands as a reminder of sports imperfection and pushing the limits of this league while we remember all those who made it what it is today.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RfmbaledOopbJloqS6sHnEr5yrZaChrrp5yKdkraCVYsC2vMSrZJunp6E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-we-do-in-the-shadows-recap-season-5-episode-9-a-weekend-at-morrigan-mano-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What We Do in the Shadows Recap: A Weekend in the Country</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./natalie-nunn-and-scotty-viral-video-twitter-baby-picture-and-reddit-update.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Natalie Nunn And Scotty Viral Video Twitter: Baby Picture And Reddit Update</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
