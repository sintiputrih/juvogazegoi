At the time, she was more vague about the reasons for her absence. However, she shared that there was “so much going on” at that time in her life, and <b>she needed her focus elsewhere</b>.</strong></p><p>For instance, Is Floribama Shore coming back 2021? Season 4 of “Floribama Shore” began filming in late 2020 and will air between February and May 2021. That means the latest adventure for the Floribama team is still fresh in fans’ minds, and MTV may be waiting to see if there’s enough enthusiasm before embarking on another holiday.</p><p>Why didn’t Maddie return to Floribama? In addition to no longer appearing on Floribama Shore, Mattie has confirmed on Twitter that she is also done with The Challenge. If her DUIs caused MTV to part ways with her, some fans feel that the brunette beauty is being unfairly discriminated against. They feel that alcoholism is a disease.</p><p>Besides, Why did Kourtney leave Floribama?</p><p>Appearing in three seasons of Floribama Shore, Kortni decided to leave mid-way through the third season to look after her mental health, following a public meltdown on the show.</p><p>Beside above, Is Kortni from Floribama Shore rich?</p><p>Floribama Shore’ star Kortni Gilson is worth $200,000</p><p>Gilson uses her platform to speak out about her experiences with depression and anxiety.
