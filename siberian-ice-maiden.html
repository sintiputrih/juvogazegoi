They also enacted restrictions on land and air traffic with neighboring regions.</p><p>But Begenov also said that the region was unique because it had the protection of the mummy princess.</p><p>“We have protection. The Altai people worship the mummy, we do treasure it,” Begenov <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> local news outlet Podyom. “When the mummy was taken to Novosibirsk, we had an earthquake here, and they say that it happened because the mummy was taken away, we shouldn’t have touched her.”</p><p>Begenov of course is speaking of the controversial removal of the mummy from the sacred burial mounds, known as kurgans, in the remote Ukok Plateau when the Iron Age corpse was first uncovered.</p><p>The Altai people’s shamans warned government officials that removing the mummy’s remains from the tomb would spur retaliation from spiritual forces.</p><p>Like magic, not long after the Siberian Ice Maiden was moved to Novosibirsk, the Altai region was hit by a major earthquake. The eerily timed natural disaster seemed to prove the mummy’s power.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275080 alt="Mummy Of The Ukok Princess" width=690 height=561 data-sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mummy-of-the-ukok-princess-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275080 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikipedia</span><span class=caption-body>The Altai Princess’s tattoos remain clearly visible after 2,400 years.</span></p><p>The mummy, also known as the Princess of Ukok and Altai Princess, was identified as a young woman from the nomadic Pazyryk tribe. This tribe’s people were closely related to the Scythian peoples that once populated the Eurasian steppes sometime between the 7th and 3rd centuries B.C.</p><p>The true identity of the mummy is still somewhat a mystery. The mummy is covered in well-preserved tattoos on both shoulders all the way to the wrist.</p><p>“It is a phenomenal level of tattoo art. Incredible,’ said Natalia Polosmak, the lead archaeologist who discovered the mummy. One of the tattoos on the mummy’s left shoulder appears to be a mythological hybrid of a deer with a griffon’s beak and Capricorn antlers.</p><p>Furthermore, the mummy was found buried with a bevy of ornaments and six horses — a burial custom found in other cultures of the world — which led archaeologists to suspect that she may have been a healer or high priestess in her life.</p><p>After the Siberian Ice Maiden’s controversial removal, it was returned to the Altai region and placed in a special mausoleum at the Anokhin National Museum in 2012.</p><h2>Priestess Mummy With Powers</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275021 alt="Artists Rendition Of Siberian Ice Maiden" width=800 height=679 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/artists-rendition-of-siberian-ice-maiden.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275021 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Siberian Times</span><span class=caption-body>Artist’s rendition of the Siberian Ice Maiden during her life.</span></p><p>Since the discovery of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Siberian Ice Maiden</a> in 1993, locals have invested a lot of faith in the mummy’s powers and shown much respect for the divinity they believe it carries.</p><p>Experts hailed the finding as one of the most important archaeological moments of modern times.</p><p>The Altai shamans declared that the mummy belonged to the Altai Princess Ochi-Bala or White Lady of Ak-Kadyn whose corpse was placed at the Ukok Plateau — considered the holiest place of the native people of the Altai Mountain — to protect the gateway to the nether world.</p><p>Besides the six bridled horses found in the mummy’s tomb site, archaeologists also discovered a meal of sheep and horse meat by her side. They also found ornaments of wood, felt, bronze, gold, and, interestingly, a small container of cannabis.</p><p>Out of respect for the customs of the Altai Indigenous tribes, the Siberian Ice Maiden’s remains can only be viewed by museum visitors during the new moon.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275124 alt="Grave Of Princess Of Ukok" width=600 height=402 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/grave-of-princess-of-ukok.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275124 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The grave site of the Princess of Ukok.</span></p><p>The priestess’ burial was meant to prevent the “penetration of Evil from the lower worlds” which is why removing the remains was predicted to have catastrophic consequences.</p><p>Not only did the removal of the remains cause a major earthquake in Altai, but a series of inexplicable misfortunes also followed the priestess mummy wherever it went.</p><p>Some say it is what caused the crash of the chopper that had been transporting her remains out of Altai, though the mummy itself was unharmed. Then, when it arrived in Novosibirsk, her remarkably well-preserved corpse suddenly began to decompose.</p><p>There is also the suspicion that the Siberian Ice Maiden is capable of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">influencing political affairs of the world</a>.

As customary during diplomatic visits, local officials hosted Clinton with a visit to several spots around the city, including an exclusive viewing of the Siberian Ice Maiden.</p><p>As the story goes, a series of misfortunes struck local officials involved with Clinton’s Novosibirsk tour.</p><p>Then, two months after Clinton’s fateful meeting with the priestess mummy, the Bill Clinton scandal broke, causing ripple effects that would cascade through to the 2016 election — as the “mummy’s curse” would have some believe.</p><p>Whether the divine powers of the Siberian Ice Maiden are real or not, maybe it is best to leave such ancient relics alone.</p><p>Next, take a look at the <a href=#>5,600-year-old mummy which used the oldest Egyptian embalming recipe ever found</a> and the remarkably well-preserved <a href=#>Qilakitsoq Mummies</a> whose last meal was identified by scientists.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0tcGeqaKZnmK2pLGMppiinJWj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-reed-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-286689-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Reed Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sommaroy-island-abolish-time.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Norwegians On 'Summer Island' With Never-Ending Sunlight Want To Abolish Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
