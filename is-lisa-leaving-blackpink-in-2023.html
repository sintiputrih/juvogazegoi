The fast-rising K-Pop group quickly became one of the most successful. K-Pop is now in chaos. Lisa worries about BLACKPINK fans. Is Lisa quitting BLACKPINK in 2023? BLACKPINK was hard to form.</p><p>YG Entertainment sought suitable candidates for its project. Jisoo, Jennie, Lisa, and Rose redeemed. They applied separately. YG Entertainment needed more castings. YG Entertainment always accepted their monthly castings—the four best-fit well. That created Blackpink. As in the below article, we will discuss Lisa leaving Blackpink in 2023 and many other things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/is-lisa-leaving-blackpink-in-2023.jpg><h2>Is Lisa leaving BLACKPINK In 2023?</h2><p>Lisa could leave BLACKPINK in 2023 because she and YG Entertainment made a deal about it. Most contracts for K-pop groups are for seven years. Since BLACKPINK came out in 2016, its value will end in August 2023. By this date, the band members and the record label must agree.</p><p><strong>Here is a Tweet by Pop Tingz about this news:&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>There are rumors circulating about Lisa from <a href=# rel=noopener>#BLACKPINK</a> leaving the group and not renewing her contract after canceling future appearances.</p><p>YG Entertainment has responded to those rumors to by stating that the scheduling uncertainty is related to the group’s tour schedule and… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3ZrWBC4sSB</a></p><p>— Pop Tingz (@ThePopTingz) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 12, 2023</a></p><p>South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo wrote a story about it. This report says there is a big difference between what YG Entertainment has to give and what Lisa Manobal wants. But there are also reports that the deals haven’t stopped and are still being kept by all members.</p><p><strong>Recently, rumors began to circulate that additional celebrities were quitting their shows, to know the truth read the posts below:</strong></p><h2>Not Only Fans But Also K-Pop Investors Are Worried</h2><p>Not only have the fights between BLACKPINK and YG Entertainment hurt their fans, but they have also hurt the K-Pop stocks that have become popular on the stock market in recent years. The shares of K-pop management company YG Entertainment have dropped by 7% because no one is sure how the contracts of BLACKPINK singers will work out. Lisa’s K-Pop career didn’t start with BLACKPINK.</p><p>Lisa (Lalisa Manoba) was born in Thailand and speaks English, Korean, and Thai very well. In 2010, when she was only 13, she joined YG Entertainment. She worked on her singing, music, and dance for years before joining the K-Pop group BLACKPINK, where she became successful.</p><p>Like many K-Pop stars, she worked hard and was disciplined to get where she is now. Lisa did well with more than just Blackpink. In September 2021, she put out her first solo record, which included the hits “Lalisa” and “Money.” In 2023, “Money” was the K-Pop female act song that played the most on Spotify. We hope Lisa can make a deal with YG Entertainment soon so that her fans can keep watching her amazing dance shows.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Follow our Twitter account</a> and check out our most recent updates on other K-pop celebrities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgbHxyg46iqmakmaiubrjEmq2ippdir62twqSnoqabYraveZFpaWxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-harrys-pals-called-him-nuts-for-dating-meghan-book-claims.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Prince Harry's pals called him 'nuts' for dating Meghan, book claims</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eric-ducharme-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eric Ducharme: Exploring the Current Whereabouts of the Mertailor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
