The supposed-to-be-scarier-than-Thanos Kang, who could rewrite timeless and erase universes, would be doing himself a favor if he opts for a crash course in “how to be a villain” from the Skrull leader, Gravik.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Some would argue that Kang killed Avengers in alternate timelines, but did that supposed murderous whim translate to the screen when the supervillain made his first appearance? Nope. First impressions are everything, people and Kang sadly misses the mark by 1000 miles. Hence, enter Gravik with his basic 101 on what makes a villain truly terrifying.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kang-killed-ants-gravik-killed-6000-in-his-first-episode data-injectable=false>Kang killed ants, Gravik killed 6000 in his first episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-kang-2.jpg><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Apart from his petty threats and grand announcements of all those he killed, all Kang managed to annihilate were a few inhabitants of the Quantum Realm and well, ants, before the latter overpowered him as well. When it came to facing to Ant-Man and his gang, Kang, for some inexplicable reason, ditched his weapon and his powers to indulge in a fistfight with them.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>And then we have Gravik, who killed 2000 people (a number fake Rhodey said would be tripled after the rumble was cleared). Even since then, he has killed the likes of Maria Hill, Talos, and anyone who dares to stand in his way. He is also not above keeping countless humans captive and infiltrating their lives for his misguided mission.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gravik-s-minions-get-things-done data-injectable=false>Gravik’s minions get things done</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/don-cheadle-secret-invasion.png><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>In case, we forget the badly CGI-ed M.O.D.O.K. and his minion butt, we can’t forgive the fact that he was useless and got nothing done. For all his pointless efforts, he only got sucker-punched by Cassie and received a very bad speech from Scott Lang. I still cringe thinking a supervillain like Kang had a goon like M.O.D.O.K. at his command.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>Despite not being a multiversal villain, Gravik has an impressive network of Skrulls in place ready to do his bidding and actually get things done.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>Talking about Gravik’s minions…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-there-is-no-better-way-to-prove-you-are-a-monster-than-by-brutally-executing-your-own-people data-injectable=false>There is no better way to prove you are a monster than by brutally executing your own people</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/40A5DA32-F407-41AC-956F-5F52507AF1AD.jpeg><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>When Gravik’s subjects do dare to rebel against him or disappoint him in any way, he ends the possibility of that happening ever again by brutally squishing it then and there — episode five is a big example of that. He ruthlessly kills his Skrull minions when they dare to speak against him, slitting the throat of the one who tries to kill him.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>And now, he is using his own people as leverage, ready to annihilate them all if it means getting his hands on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Harvest</a> and defeating Fury.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-don-t-scream-out-your-splendid-plans data-injectable=false>Don’t scream out your splendid plans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gravik-secret-invasion-1.jpg><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=false>Kang was giving out his plan to leave the Quantum Realm and what he had in mind to make it happen to anyone who was listening, making it very easy for the heroes to wreck it. But Gravik, the true mastermind, has been pulling unexpected tricks out of his Skrull pocket in every episode. The man (er.. Skrull) is playing on so many fronts — distracting Fury with false plans and defeating him at every turn, infiltrating the biggest organizations, perfecting the Super Skrull serum, keeping tabs on his spies, etc.&nbsp;Kang, we hope you’re taking notes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRma2akmZuybrjErKqopqNitq951aKjpZmZo8Zut8CnnmamlZqxtHnTqGSlnZGnu26y0aikZp%2BilsOqt4yipWarlZi%2FpsCMoqWvmaOevK97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-maura-west-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Maura West? | Wiki, Age, Bio, Net Worth, Career, Relationship, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rob-pattinsons-exes-kristen-stewart-dylan-penn-party-in-paris-2015291.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Pattinson's Exes Kristen Stewart, Dylan Penn Party in Paris</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
