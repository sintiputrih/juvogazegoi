The former America’s Funniest Home Videos host had been on the show since season 1 in 2005, and the sportscaster joined him nine years later after competing on season 10. Two days after the news broke, the network revealed that <a href=#>Banks had been tapped to take over</a> for season 29.</p><p>“Tyra is an award-winning multihyphenate whose fierce female prowess and influence across many industries have made an indelible mark,” ABC Entertainment president <strong>Karey Burke</strong> said in a statement at the time. “Her fresh take on America’s favorite dancing competition will surely bring more than a ‘smize’ to fans everywhere.”</p><p>While Banks was no stranger to reality TV, having previously hosted shows including America’s Next Top Model and America’s Got Talent, it took her a few weeks to settle into her new role.</p><p>“Tonight I hosted the second episode of Dancing With the Stars that I’m hosting this season, and <a href=#>it wasn’t perfect</a>,” she admitted in a September 2020 TikTok video. “Yeah, I had a lot of fun, but I messed up, I said the wrong words. But the thing is, I kept, kept going.”</p><p>The model had another snafu the following month when she <a href=#>announced the wrong bottom two couples</a> due to an issue in the control room. After taking a second to figure out what went wrong, she composed herself like a consummate professional and proceeded to read the correct results.</p><p>“I think Tyra dealt with it amazingly,” DWTS executive producer <strong>Andrew Llinares</strong> later told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “I just want to be really clear, this was not Tyra’s fault. It was a behind-the-scenes issue.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Bruno Tonioli</strong></a>, who has served as a judge on the show since its inception, also rushed to Banks’ defense, telling the outlet, “It’s live television, things like this happen, especially with information coming in from all over the country, voting and calculating in such a small amount of time. Tyra was brilliant. … She was really good because she took control of the situation.”</p><p>Following DWTS’ <a href=#>switch from ABC to Disney+</a>, the network announced that Banks would be cohosting with <a href=#><strong>Alfonso Ribeiro</strong></a> for season 31.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“So excited to finally reveal this! I’m reuniting with a very special someone I worked with when I was just 19 years old,” Banks, who worked with the actor on Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, gushed via Instagram in July 2022. “I can’t wait to stream live & have crazy fun w/ him!💃🏽🕺🏽”</p><p>Scroll down to revisit Banks’ quotes about hosting DWTS!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Baw6a%2B2K2foqaXYsG6vsBmmZqmm6h6tK3InWSamp%2BqwW60zqyroqaXYrGiusKipaBlp57BqXnToZxmq6SWv7R7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./judas-and-the-black-messiah-the-true-story-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Judas And The Black Messiah: The True Story Explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-max-gomez-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dr Max Gomez Wife, Age, Wiki, Cause Of Death, Parents, Net Worth 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
