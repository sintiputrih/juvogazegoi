Walker Nathanial Diggs, now 13 years old, was born to the ex-couple in September 2009. They eventually parted amicably a few years later, but they still think highly of one another.</p><p>In a 2022 interview with PEOPLE, the Best Man actor was asked about co-parenting and he only had good things to say about Menzel.</p><p>He said, “She rules the show. “She manages Walker’s whereabouts when he needs to be there despite having a career and her own connections. Because of her, he has the best coaches and teachers, we attend the best schools, and all of this is possible.”</p><p>Similar views on co-parenting have been expressed by Menzel, who stated to PEOPLE Now in 2016 that “Your child comes first, that’s all.” He comes first, you have to put aside your egos, and you never speak poorly of one another, she continued.</p><p>The Frozen actress also opened up to PEOPLE about what she’s discovered about motherhood.</p><p>“When I became a mother, it was actually extremely liberating since everything was so self-centered. It also teaches you about priorities and perspective when you have these adorable, little people to worry about “Menzel remarked.</p><p>She went on, “And you make mistakes on a daily basis. However, if you approach parenting from a position of love and forgiveness and strive to be a strong, rooted tree for your children, they will know that you are not going to — you may bend, but you won’t break. That, in my opinion, is the best way to demonstrate to them your love and commitment to them.”</p><p>Learn everything there is to know about Walker Nathanial Menzel, the son of Idina Menzel and Taye Diggs.</p><h3>He was born on Sept. 2, 2009</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/idina-menzel-taye-diggs-son-2-bdd961eb906b4edebe583c9c7e83dfdf.jpg alt="walker nathaniel diggs age,walker nathaniel diggs net worth,taye diggs net worth,taye diggs wife,how many kids does taye diggs have,idina menzel net worth,taye diggs,walker nathaniel diggs now,walker nathaniel diggs 2021,walker nathaniel diggs 2022,walker nathaniel diggs mom,walker nathaniel diggs 2020,walker nathaniel diggs birthday,walker nathaniel diggs parents,how old is walker nathaniel diggs,idina menzel walker nathaniel diggs,daughter walker nathaniel diggs,son walker nathaniel diggs,taye diggs walker nathaniel diggs" width=750 height=563 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On September 2, 2009, Walker Nathaniel Diggs was born.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub14f3fb1e735089947348257754cd643><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>All American season 5: What happened to Coach Baker on All American?</span></a><p>Diggs told PEOPLE in advance of his arrival how thrilled he and Menzel were to have a baby.</p><p>“We have locations in Los Angeles and New York.

However, she asserts that her son is more stylish than she is. Walker loves sneakers and has a sizable collection, the proud mother revealed in a PEOPLE interview. Walker was not pleased when Menzel showed up to pick him up from school wearing a pair of his Yeezys, but she wears the same size as her 13-year-old son, which is a blessing for Menzel.</p><p>“I’ve been robbing him of his shoes. Because he has a collection of sneakers, it’s really thrilling that we’re now in the same size “Telling PEOPLE, Idina. “The other day I was running to pick him up from school and I was too lazy to run up the stairs to get my own shoes, so I threw on a pair of his Yeezys.”</p><p>He reportedly gave the actress a “glare of death” when she arrived to pick him up because he was concerned that she wouldn’t take good care of his shoes.</p><h3>He’s sweet to his mom</h3><p>Menzel acknowledged that she had a “hard time” turning 50 and that the significant birthday had made her feel self-conscious in a 2021 interview with Glamour. But her son gave her the confidence to go past her fears.</p><p>“I hate to admit it, but I was struggling with it. Regarding my value as a performer and actress, I believe it was subconsciously upsetting me more than I let on. Sometimes I feel like the elderly lady, but that’s not who I am “Menzel remarked. “At heart, I feel quite young.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u22af7ad53ee0e8e8181cc81bc62112fe><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>All American season 5: What happened to Coach Baker on All American?</span></a><p>She continued by sharing the guidance Walker had given her. “”Mom, don’t worry about how you seem in the mirror,” he advises. You are stunning.”</p><p>The singer added that she wants to deliberately try to provide a good example for her son after recalling how her own mother would constantly point out her flaws anytime she looked in the mirror, despite the fact that Menzel thought she was attractive.</p><p>Additionally, Menzel is kind to Walker; she admitted to PEOPLE that she frequently places personal notes in his lunchbox, “regardless of whether they embarrass him or not.”</p><h3>He’s a tattoo artist for his dad</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/idina-menzel-taye-diggs-son-4-5e6087b51e2146efbc563e3325cfcce8.jpg alt="walker nathaniel diggs age,walker nathaniel diggs net worth,taye diggs net worth,taye diggs wife,how many kids does taye diggs have,idina menzel net worth,taye diggs,walker nathaniel diggs now,walker nathaniel diggs 2021,walker nathaniel diggs 2022,walker nathaniel diggs mom,walker nathaniel diggs 2020,walker nathaniel diggs birthday,walker nathaniel diggs parents,how old is walker nathaniel diggs,idina menzel walker nathaniel diggs,daughter walker nathaniel diggs,son walker nathaniel diggs,taye diggs walker nathaniel diggs" width=750 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>CONVERSING with PEOPLE Diggs revealed his Father’s Day plans for 2018, which included commissioning Walker to create some artwork for a tattoo.</p><p>It wasn’t the first time the happy father had a tattoo of one of his son’s drawings.
