For the first few episodes he goes a bit overboard at the clubs. One night, he gets a bit too drunk and he starts hooking up with Grenades. The Situation weighs in on what’s going on as he says “Ronnie’s at the club, hooking up with Grenades… that is a bigger-ugly-chick & also Landmines.. which is a thin-ugly-chick .. and um, lovin’ life. His name is Ronnie, but you can probably call him Sloppy Joe.” Well said sir, well said.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 Episode 2 ‘The Hangover’</a> – The Start of the I.F.F.</strong></p><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>First catchphrase of the season comes in episode 2, it is here that the I.F.F. is born. At the start of season 2, Ron has a bit of a problem. The problem is that Ron is out at the club, wheeling grenades, but at the end of the night, he ends up sleeping with Sam in her bed. When Sam finds out he’s coming into her bed after behaving the way he did, shit is going to hit the fan. The boys start speculating on how the situation is going to turn out and as Pauly D says “Ronnie’s new name is I.F.F. (I’m Fucked Foundation), he’s the client and the president.”</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 Episode 2 ‘The Hangover’</a> – Snooki Ruins Dinner</strong></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#><img decoding=async title=202 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/202.jpg alt width=600 height=340 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></strong></p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>As usual, Situation is busy preparing dinner for the gang. After he finishes, he puts the meat in the fridge. He warns everyone to be careful when they open the fridge and to make sure the chicken doesn’t slide out. It’s a blatant act of foreshadowing but sure enough Snooki comes prancing in, opens the fridge and the chicken spills all over her. Predictable, yet funny as hell.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>I think Vinny put it best when he says “Snooki is a walking disaster, she attracts drama.” Of course it isn’t Snooki’s fault at all and when Vinny asks her to clean it, the mental competency she displays is akin to that of a flea. She has absolutely no idea what to do. Vinnie walks out to break the news to Situation and asks him what to do. Situation simply replies “pick that shit up dawg.”</p><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=93 data-injectable=false>Despite taking place back in episode 2, this is still one of the season’s funniest moments.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 Episode 2 ‘The Hangover’</a> – Situation Orders Dinner</strong></p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>After Snooki destroys the meal Sitch has been cooking, the gang needs a replacement. Situation calls a restaurant to order pick up, the scene plays out like this.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>The Situation: Can I place an order?<br>Delivery guy: What’s the name?<br>The Situation: Situation.<br>Delivery guy: Name?<br>The Situation: Yeah. Situation. Capital S-i-t-u-a-t-i-o-n.<br>Delivery guy: Whatever man, what’s your order?</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>Hilarious and easily one of the funniest scenes involving Situation. I’m not sure if Sitch was being serious or not but it was very funny.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 Episode 2 ‘The Hangover’</a> – Pauly D/Sitch/Angelina fight</strong></p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>After a night out, Sitch, Pauly and Angelina arrive home. Angelina tells Pauly D that she loves him and wants to marry him. Things get weird and an argument eventually breaks out which results in Angelina slapping Pauly D.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Situation pleads with her to go to bed because she’s drunk but she won’t have any of it. Situation storms off and pretty soon after Pauly D follows. The boys go outside to talk and Angelina follows them out and continues to fight. She’s clearly a drunken mess and I really don’t know what she’s trying to get out of this. She sure is relentless though. The episode ends with Pauly D flipping out at her and telling her she’s now on her own, she has no one, him and Situation are done with her.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>No matter what the situation is, whenever Pauly D gets mad, it’s always a highlight. When he loses his temper he really loses it. It only happens a few times this season but each time is better than the last.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 Episode 3 ‘Creepin’ </a>–&nbsp; JWOWW’s Boobs Defy Gravity</strong>.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>As the crew is getting ready to go out, JWOWW puts on a pretty ridiculous outfit. Vinny is especially surprised as he tells us JWOWW’s boobs defy gravity, he claims “Albert Einstein should come back and rewrite his laws of physics and rework them around Jenni’s tits.”</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=60 data-injectable=false>Not so much a funny moment, just a very funny line from Vin.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 Episode 3 ‘Creepin’ </a>– Vin Does The Unthinkable</strong></p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Vinny did it, he did the unthinkable. One night, he gets home from the club and passes out on a bean bag chair. He is then joined by Snooki who sits down beside him. They start getting a bit touchy and Snooki makes a quick phone call to her boyfriend. She tells him she has the hiccups, which to her is apparently the funniest thing ever. When she tries to get up she knocks over the table and lets out a piercing scream. She grabs Vinny and the two go to his room and get in bed together. Snook asks Vinnie if he wants to fuck and Vinny says sure .</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>In the morning a confused Vinny wakes up and asks “did I bang Snooki last night, did I do the unthinkable?”</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>Yes Vinny you did, you did the unthinkable. I’m surprised none of the other house members really made a big deal about this, it’s pretty jokes but they kinda of just acted like it was no big deal.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 Episode 3 ‘Creepin’</a> – We’ve Got Grenades</strong></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#><img decoding=async title=203 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/203.jpg alt width=600 height=340 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></strong></p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Back at their place, after a night out, the boys hop in the hot tub with the girls they took home. All is going well until Situation splashes some water on his faces and realizes the unthinkable. They’ve got grenades!! Situation starts freaking out and tries to tell Pauly but according to him, Pauly was hypnotized, one of the hyenas hypnotzied him!</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>Then when things couldn’t get any worse, one of the girl’s fake boobs falls out into the tub. At first no one really knows what it is. Sitch tries to describe it but he’s baffled, he simply says “I don’t know what the fuck it was.”</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Pauly D tells them to put it on the grill because apparently it looks like a chicken cutlet. The boys start playing catch with it but that’s the last straw. They promptly kick the girls out because as Situation says “this is a grenade free zone.”</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 episode 4 ‘Breaking Up’</a> – The Acronym Line</strong></p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>This isn’t so much a great scene as it is a great line. During the day we see the boys head to the gym. Situation explains to us “you got to be on your tip top game with your G.T.L., so you can stay F.T.D., to get the girls to D.T.F., in M.I.A.”</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Not sure how he comes up with this stuff but it’s very funny.</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true><strong><a href=#>Season 2 episode 5 ‘The ‘Letter’ </a>– The Master Plan</strong></p><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>The M.V.P. team gets back to the house one night and brings home with them two girls. But then something happens. Another two girls arrive at the house unexpectedly. These are two girls that Situation had told to come over earlier. His intentions were to use these girls as backups since they were D.T.F. Well now he’s in trouble. He ended up getting girls from the club to come back yet these two other ‘backup girls’ showed up. Now the guys have a true situation on their hands. Instead of turning the D.T.F girls away, Situation decides to wing it.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>So now the boys have 4 girls in the house. The two girls from the club in one room and the two D.T.F. ‘backup girls’ in the other room. The two sets of girls are unaware of each other. Situation takes charge of the predicament and devises a master plan.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>He must separate the two D.T.F. girls. One is a hippopotamus according to him, so he has to isolate the hot one. He says he’ll let the ‘grenade’ blow up in Ron’s room. So while Sitch is taking care of that, Vin and Pauly will go do their thing with the two girls from the club.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>Shockingly the plan works. They all get the girls they want and it goes off without a hitch. Very impressive.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>The entire scene is hilarious. I’m sure it was heavily scripted but it’s still very jokes to watch play out. Situation explaining to us how he’s going to go about executing his plan is just so ridiculous that you can’t resist laughing out loud. Easily one of the season’s funniest scenes.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=70 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 episode 7 ‘Sleeping with the Enemy’</a> – Snooki Is Tan</strong></p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Here we have another great line, courtesy of Snooki. During the day, at the beach, Snooki makes a super intelligent comment when JWOWW calls her white. Snook says that she’s not white, she’s tan and on job applications when they ask what race she is, she puts other and writes tan.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>Honestly, I have no doubt in my mind that this is true and that Snooki actually does this.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 episode 8 ‘All In The Family’ </a>– The 6am Girl</strong></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#><img decoding=async title=208 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/208.jpg alt width=600 height=340 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></strong></p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Sitch and Pauly come home one night with two girls. Of course Sitch fucks it up and the girls end up leaving and the boys have nothing. So now it’s 6am but both Pauly and Sitch hit the phone looking for girls. Shockingly, they get one. Pauly says if a girl comes over at 3am she’s D.T.F, but if she comes at 6am, well not even Pauly knows what that means. Nevertheless, a girl comes over for Pauly but she doesn’t bring anyone for Situation, this makes him pretty upset.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>He doesn’t know what to do with himself so he makes himself an egg sandwich and watches Pauly and the girl go at it. Did anyone else find this very creepy? Situation watching his best friend get it on with a girl.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Not only was this funny because the boys hit the phones at 6am looking for girls (like were they that desperate?), but in addition to that, they actually find one. And then with Situation watching Pauly at the end, that was just weird. Sitch even says ‘I had a fist row seat for a slam session’.</p><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=83 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 episode 11 ‘Girls Like That’ </a>– The Prophecy + Attempted Burglary</strong></p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Ok so here it is, I think this was the funniest line this season, or at least top 3. The gang heads out at night and they go to Klutch. Situation has his keen eyes on and he realizes there are lots of grenades, it’s like a war zone out there. Pauly reminds us that safety comes first and Situation tells us “Back in the day they had the prophecy, that one day there’d be a pimp of all pimps and his name would be the Situation.”</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Later at the club, Situation has his eyes on Ramona and tells us she’s one of the hottest girls he has ever seen. Vin leaves Ramona for a second to go to the washroom and Situation attempts a burglary. He tells us “everybody knows I’m a pimp, you know that’s how it is man, my grandpappy was a pimp, his grandpappy was a pimp, I’m about to get to business right now.”</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Fantastic scene. Two hilarious quotes, and an attempted burglary by Sitch, which fails but is still very funny to watch play out. Easily the highlight of the episode and those two lines are amongst the best of the season.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2&nbsp; episode 12 ‘Deja Vu All Over Again’</a> – Watch Me Play Checkers</strong></p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>While out one night, the gang gets into a bit of argument with another couple at the club. Pretty soon the bouncers intervene and they get kicked out. Being the quick thinker he is, Pauly D manages to grab two girls as they’re getting kicked out. After all, he can’t go home alone and neither can Sitch. Sitch and Pauly want to ‘get it in’, so they go back to the house while the rest of the gang heads elsewhere.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Pauly confirms our suspicions when he tells us that the only reason he grabbed these girls is because there D.T.F. He then explains to us that you got to get these girls in bed, talk to them for a bit then ‘get it in’. Thanks for the tips Pauly.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>Anyway, as expected, Sitch runs into a bit of a situation. His girl won’t hook up with him and he gets upset. He tells her to go to another room and he’s going to go to sleep. This of course makes it weird for Pauly because he’s with her friend. Sitch tells the girl he doesn’t want to waste time and he tells her to go sleep on the couch.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>The girl isn’t pleased though. She comes back to Sitch’s room to talk to him. Situation gets pissed and drops one of the best lines all season. He tells her “don’t come over to somebody’s house at fuckin 5am and expect just to watch me play Checkers.” Checkers? Really Sitch? Where did that even come from? Like of all the things he could have said he says Checkers. I bet Sitch doesn’t even know how to play Checkers.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>The girl is as surprised as us and she replies “what, I never said anything about checkers old man.” Eventually both girls leave and Mike and Pauly are left with no girls. Pauly is pissed because his girl was D.T.F. and Mike “let his situation get the best of him.”</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Sitch never seems to learn his lesson. This is not the first time he’s fucked things up for Pauly and it surely won’t be the last. Every time he does it is hilarious but this time is especially funny since he drops that line about playing checkers. Classic Situation.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 episode 12 ‘Deja Vu All Over Again’ </a>– Parking Situation</strong></p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Vin and Situation go tanning and Sitch thinks it’d be a good idea to park in a towing zone. Of course he gets towed and when he finds out, he can’t believe it. He calls the towing company and tells them he has a situation. He tells them his car has been….but he can’t think of the word, he just stutters and tries to think of it. Finally Vin gives him the word, towed, and Situation proceeds to tell the guy on the phone what happened.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Situation and Vin go looking all over Miami, trying to find this towing place but they keep getting lost. Vin tells us it’s like the guido version of The Amazing Race. They finally find it and manage to get their car back. Mike isn’t too happy with the fine they had to pay though.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>This was very entertaining to watch. Sitch and Vin running all over town to find the car due to Situation’s stupidity. And when Situation couldn’t think of the word on the phone, wow, just wow.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#>Season 2 episode 13 ‘Back Into The Fold’ </a>– One Last Fight</strong></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=#><img decoding=async title=213 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/213.jpg alt width=600 height=340 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></strong></p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>JWOWW calls Mike fake which sets him off. Snooki tells JWOWW that a bunch of people in the house thought she was the fake one. JWOWW then tells Mike that it was Pauly who called him fake. Pauly gets enraged and screams at JWOWW for telling lies. Pauly loses it and actually scares the girls. He gets very angry and tells them he would never talk bad about Situation.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>As I said before, anytime Pauly D gets mad it’s worth watching, this time is no different. This is the angriest he’s got all season and Snooki actually screams in horror.
