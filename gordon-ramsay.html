You never get a chance to sit down and eat. They don’t actually sit down and eat before you cook. So when I finish work, the first thing I’ll do, and especially when I’m in New York, I’ll go for a run. And I’ll run 10 or 15k on me – and I run to gain my appetite.”&nbsp;<strong>– Gordon Ramsay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The pressure on young chefs today is far greater than ever before in terms of social skills, marketing skills, cooking skills, personality and, more importantly, delivering on the plate. So you need to be strong. Physically fit. So my chefs get weighed every time they come into the kitchen.”&nbsp;<strong>– Gordon Ramsay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“As a soccer player, I wanted a FA Cup winner’s medal. So pushing yourself to the extreme creates a lot of pressure and a lot of excitement, and more importantly, it shows on the plate.”&nbsp;<strong>– Gordon Ramsay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I train my chefs completely different to anyone else. My young girls and guys, when they come to the kitchen, the first thing they get is a blindfold. They get blindfolded and they get sat down at the chef’s table… Unless they can identify what they’re tasting, they don’t get to cook it.”&nbsp;<strong>– Gordon Ramsay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I still love football, though, and I think cooking is like football. It’s not a job, it’s a passion. When you become good at it, it’s a dream job and financially you need never to worry. Ever.”&nbsp;<strong>– Gordon Ramsay&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>3 Amazing Gordon Ramsay Lessons</h2><p>Now that you are fully aware of Gordon Ramsay’s wealth and his path to success, let’s look at some of the most valuable lessons we can draw from him:</p><h3>1. Never Let Your Thirst for Knowledge Die Out</h3><p>You must constantly be in student mode. Keep on with whatever you want to do in life. Continue your education and exploring new things. Never let your desire to learn fade. Always remind yourself that it is not enough. No matter how much knowledge or potential you believe you possess, you are always a student. So avoid becoming complacent.</p><h3>2. Get it off your chest; let it go, don’t hold it in</h3><p>Release whatever bad emotions you may have! Avoid keeping it indoors for too long. Feeling all of that repressed energy inside of you is the worst.</p><p>However, this does not imply that you should yell or scream anytime you feel the urge to express yourself. Follow your preferences. Pause, breathe, practice meditation, or simply speak with someone. Just don’t wait till it interferes with your work to let it out.</p><h3>3. Remain Genuinely Yourself</h3><p>No matter what, Gordon Ramsay freely and proudly declares that he is a chef. Just who are you? We become overly attached to multiple identities, such as the title of our employment, and eventually lose our true selves. We become unhappy, unmotivated, and ultimately lost in the process.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Considered to be among the top chefs in the world is Gordon Ramsay. 14 Michelin stars are now awarded to his eateries.
