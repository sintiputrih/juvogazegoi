I am also an advocate for animals (both wild and domestic) and the environment. During leisure time, I enjoy (among other activities) engaging with my favorite fictional stories, including <i>Pokémon</i>.<p><i>Pokémon</i> has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started off collecting the trading cards, playing with the toys, watching the anime (including movies), and playing <i>Pokémon Stadium 2</i>. It is a franchise that me and my younger sister always enjoyed together growing up, and that continues to this day.</p><p>My first mainline <i>Pokémon</i> game was <i>Ruby</i>. I had so much fun catching, nicknaming, and training my very own team of Pokémon for the first time. I replayed <i>Ruby</i> and its upgraded version <i>Emerald</i> so many times that I lost track of the number. As each new generation and set of games were released, me and my sister would get the alternative versions of each (a tradition that started with <i>Ruby/Sapphire</i>), of which we decided together on who gets what. In addition to <i>Ruby</i>, the versions that I got and played were <i>Fire Red</i>, <i>Diamond</i>, <i>Soul Silver</i>, <i>White</i>, <i>Black 2</i>, <i>X</i>, <i>Alpha Sapphire</i>, <i>Sun</i>, <i>Ultra Moon</i>, <i>Let's Go Eevee</i>, <i>Shield</i>, <i>Shining Pearl</i>, and <i>Scarlet</i>. I highly enjoyed every single one of them, and I always look forward to the upcoming games.</p><p>Right now my favorite <i>Pokémon</i> game is <i>Scarlet</i>, with <i>Shield</i> being a very close second. I enjoyed both of these games so much that I also got and played <i>Sword</i> and <i>Violet</i> a few months after finishing <i>Shield</i> and <i>Scarlet</i>, respectively (though admittedly I've still yet to finish <i>Violet</i> - I've been busy with my IRL treasure hunt and my team is not built for battling fairy cars, XD). I just really loved the characters and their stories from these games, and they helped me cope with difficult life situations (<i>Sword</i>/<i>Shield</i> gave me something positive to focus on when I was grieving the death of my childhood dog, and <i>Scarlet</i>/<i>Violet</i> is helping me process the trauma of being bullied throughout my childhood).</p><p>In addition to the mainline games, I also play <i>Pokémon GO</i> and <i>Pokémon Masters EX</i>. Lately, I've been reading the manga for my favorite <i>Pokémon </i>games, and I have gotten back into collecting the trading cards after many years of hiatus. When I'm not engaging with official material, I enjoy creating fan-arts (including fan-comics) and fan-fictions of/about my favorite characters (which I post on AO3, DeviantArt [username currently RainforestWolf], and currently FFN).</p><p>I've been using Bulbapedia for information about <i>Pokémon</i> for years, but only now did I decide to join its forum. I look forward to discussing everything <i>Pokémon</i> with the other <i>Pokémon</i> fans on this forum.</p><p>Hasta la vistar!</p><p>DISCLAIMER: All opinions are my own and should NOT be interpreted as the viewpoints of my university or lab.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyqutOrpp2tk6m2sLqMraZmpZVirq%2BwjKawZqCZqMGwvthmrqKsmGK9sLfEpqanZmNlf3OAkGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-vaughn-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Vaughn Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./raquels-engagement-ring-worth-vanderpump-rules.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Is Raquel Leviss's Engagement Ring Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
