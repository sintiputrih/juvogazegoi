The latest entry in the long-running gaming series was announced in 2020 for PlayStation consoles but was delayed several times since, as the developers were dealing with the COVID’19 pandemic and other production challenges, including <a href=#>Christopher Judge’s surgery</a>.</p><p>As stated in <a href=#>last year’s report</a>, the game’s release was initially rescheduled for this year’s release date, but all talk about the game ceased following Sony’s statement about the delay, prompting many to believe that the game was delayed once again, internally, without Sony’s public acknowledgment. Now, according to <a href=#>IGN</a>, God of War: Ragnarok is expected to launch in November, despite several reports that suggested it had been delayed to 2023.</p><p>The rumors about the game’s further delay were fueled by God of War: Ragnarok’s absence from this year’s State of Play, which <a href=#>announced the highly anticipated</a> Resident Evil 4 remake. However, those rumors have been discredited, and the game’s official release date is likely to be revealed in the upcoming days. It’s worth pointing out that release dates aren’t certain in the turbulent world of game development, as indicated by the massive delays plaguing the industry.</p><p>Still, at least for the time being, God of War: Ragnarok remains on track for November. The game will bring its protagonist Kratos and his son Atreus back to Midgard a few years after the events of 2018’s Norse-inspired reboot of the series. Furthermore, the game’s developer, Santa Monica, described the <a href=#>upcoming game as the finale</a> of the Norse Saga — something a part of the fandom considers disappointing, especially since the original series was a trilogy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/god-of-war-mjolnir-900x509.jpg><p>The new game also introduces new villains, and Kratos and Atreus (revealed as Loki) will have to face Freya and Thor, the Queen and Prince of Asgard, and determine the fates of everyone living in the Nine Realms as Ragnarok approaches. In our previous report, we jokingly asked about God of War coming to PC, and the game <a href=#>was announced for PC</a> just a couple of months later. We don’t consider ourselves prophetic, but we would also like to know what are the odds of God of War: Ragnarok being released for PC as well?</p><p>Well, that remains to be seen. The game is currently scheduled for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, and the inclusion of the former turned out to be a good business decision on Sony’s part, considering the ongoing absence of PS5 from the market. With that said, the company is planning to <a href=#>halt the development of PlayStation 4 games</a> by 2025, with 30% of its future releases aimed at the PC market. So, the addition of God of War: Ragnarok into various PC gaming collections isn’t out of the realm of possibilities.</p><p>AS things currently are, God of War: Ragnarok is scheduled to release in November this year, though we’re still pending the official release date revealed by Sony. The upcoming sequel to <a href=#>the best game</a> in the God of War series is set to release on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8aapJ6rX5y8pXnOn2SwmaJiv6KzzZqpqKNdp7KtscCsnGackamyb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-fast-is-the-aerosmith-ride-at-disney.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How fast is the Aerosmith ride at Disney?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chessbae94-face-revealed-meet-him-on-twitch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chessbae94 Face Revealed: Meet Him On Twitch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
