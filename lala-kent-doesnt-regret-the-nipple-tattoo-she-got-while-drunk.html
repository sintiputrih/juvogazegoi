I have a heart around my right nip. I was mimosa drunk when I got it, & no I do not regret it,” she shamelessly explained.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While she loves her ink, some reservations did come into play when she welcomed her 2-month-old daughter, whom she shares with fiancé <strong>Randall Emmett</strong>, in March.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I asked my mom, ‘Do you think Ocean’s gonna be like, weirded out, that I have this tattoo as she gets older?’” she said in a later Instagram Stories. “My mom said, ‘No, she’s not gonna know any different.’ And I love that answer.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lala-Kent-Got-A-Nipple-Tattoo-While-Drunk-Worries-What-Daughter-Thinks-Inline-2.jpg><p class=p1>Along with her heart-shaped nipple tattoo, Kent also has approximately 10 other designs. And, she opened about the meaning behind most of them in a <a href=#>Bravo video</a> on June 2.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Her first tattoo was her “man’s initials,” which she got on her inner arm. “I got it in Las Vegas, that was my very first tattoo ever. A little ‘R’ and a little E,” she said in the short clip.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>But the Give Them Lala author’s inaugural ink wasn’t all rainbows and butterflies — the “E” was “so crooked.” As a solution, Kent decided to cover it up. “I would look at it and I’m like, “Get it off!” And I’ve always wanted a lion tattoo so I’m like let’s just throw the king of the jungle right over the king of my life.”</p><p class=p1>The new mom also revealed that she has “thug life” on her leg, the name of her dog, Lily, on her ankle and an orca on the side of her boob.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>When it comes to tribute ink, the star has “heathen” written above her elbow in honor of her mom. She said, “My mom used to call me her little heathen.” The star also has “dad” enclosed in a heart on her upper arm as well as “rand,” a nickname for her fiancé.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Her “most important” design however is her “GIVE THEM LALA” tattoo on her right arm, which was done with white ink. “It’s the sickest tattoo ever. How did I forget my own hashtag?!” she exclaimed toward the end of the clip.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>She continued: “It’s not even about just like the Lala part. It’s like ‘Giving Them Lala’ just means like, ‘Do you, boo.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Gura2MpJynrF2ZvKa%2Fza1kq52Xp7K1edOhnGammaW9rbGMrZitrJ%2BkerS0xGaeqKxdrLWquMRmm6utnqB8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./missy-elliott.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Missy Elliott</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khabib-nurmagomedov-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-114370-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khabib Nurmagomedov Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
