Each of the first three U.K. print runs of Ian Fleming’s first novel Casino Royale sold out within a month and earned the author a three-book deal. While it took a few editions for the series to make a mark in the U.S., Fleming had hit on publishing gold with his Bond stories. His tales of the British intelligence officer drew on the author’s experience in British Naval Intelligence during World War II, and within a few years, the books were bolstered by the Eon film series of which the last release was 2021’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No Time To Die</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>The official film series diverged from the novels from the start, and if you’re familiar with 007’s cinematic exploits, then you may be surprised by Fleming’s source novels.&nbsp;Set in the 1950s and early 1960s, his books are very much of their time. While the films have contended with altered continuity and changing attitudes over the past half-century, some of the themes and descriptions Fleming used should be approached with caution by modern audiences.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Just as James Bond’s on-screen exploits weren’t ready to shut down in the mid-1960s, the books survived Fleming’s death in 1964. So far, the series has been continued in various styles and periods by eight authors.&nbsp;The Ian Fleming Estate even commissioned the spin-off series Young James Bond and The Moneypenny Diaries, although this list will target the official adult Bond novels.</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Here is the ideal reading order for James Bond’s many appearances on the page.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Ian Fleming’s James Bond books</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/James_Bond_Ian_Fleming.jpg><p data-characters=642 data-current-count=942 data-injectable=true>Fleming published a Bond book every year from 1953 to his death. When Dr. No became the first Eon film, it drew on the title and rough plot of the more recent 1958 novel, establishing a break from the novel continuity that would last. The movies would notably use this to their advantage, picking plot points from different books and assembling movies that responded better to cinematic trends. Examples include the Blaxploitation&nbsp;film riffs of 1973’s Live and Let Die and the Star Wars-inspired space fights of 1979’s Moonraker. However, the films would make memorable use of Fleming’s zinging titles up to 2008’s Quantum of Solace.</p><ul data-items-injection=true data-current-count=858 data-injectable=true><li>Casino Royale (1953)</li><li>Live and Let Die (1954)</li><li>Moonraker (1955)</li><li>Diamonds Are Forever (1956)</li><li>From Russia, with Love (1957)</li><li data-injectable=true>Dr. No (1958)</li><li>Goldfinger (1959)</li><li>For Your Eyes Only (1960 ⏤ includes the short stories For Your Eyes Only, Quantum of Solace, Risico, and The Hildebrand Rarity)</li><li>Thunderball (1961)</li><li>The Spy Who Loved Me (1962)</li><li>On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1963)</li><li>You Only Live Twice (1964)</li><li>The Man with the Golden Gun (1965)</li><li>Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966 ⏤ includes the short stories Octopussy, The Living Daylights, The Property of a Lady, and 007 in New York)</li></ul><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Reading Ian Fleming’s Bond novels chronologically&nbsp;</strong></h3><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>Ian Fleming was famously vague on dates in his Bond books, although scholars have agreed that their chronology roughly follows their publication order.
