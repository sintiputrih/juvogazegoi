The performer will win over the judges and the live audience with her charm, voice range, and singing abilities. She will be one of many outstanding abilities on display on the reality program.&nbsp;The American Idol contender will recount her touching narrative in order to please judges Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, and Sofia Vergara. Aubrey previously auditioned for American Idol Season 16 in 2018 and ended in the Top 70. She is poised to make her debut on a new stage this time, with new ambitions and dreams. Only time will tell whether she can reclaim the crown.</p><h2>Aubrey Burchell, an AGT participant, was diagnosed with level one autism</h2><p>As Aubrey Burchell took the stage, the AGT crowd welcomed her with applause. The 21-year-old Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based singer stated that she works at Target and goes into the restroom with her phone to sing. The competitor hopes to sell stadiums across the globe and win GRAMMYs.&nbsp;She also discussed her new diagnosis of level-one autism and how she has dealt with her difficulties. She said that she want to be an encouragement to those who were going through similar experiences. According to the AGT contestant:</p><p>“I want to encourage other young autistics who are suffering in silence that you can pursue your passion, not fit into a box, and do what you love.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Aubrey-Burchell-2.jpg alt="Aubrey Burchell" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Aubrey then drove the judges and crowd to tears with her interpretation of The Weeknd’s Call Out My Name. The judges praised her for being courageous and sharing her tale, and Sofia referred to her as “the full package.” The AGT judge believed the contender had a good chance of winning the competition.&nbsp;Aubrey was born on January 6, 2001, and early developed a passion for music. Her father was a musician, and they used to create small tunes together. The singer’s first listeners were in preschool. She has since performed at local charity events. She has also been working with a voice coach since she was 15 years old.</p><p>After finishing in the Top 70 of American Idol, the AGT candidate spoke out about her experience in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, saying:</p><p>“It’s one of my proudest accomplishments and something I never dreamed I’d do. I’m glad for the chance, which served as a launching pad for what I feel was to come later.”</p><p>Aubrey had been singing in Western Pennsylvania venues in November 2020, a year after the virus struck, when performing live became impossible. The singer said that it was a difficult period for her and that spending long hours at Target without being able to sing was psychologically draining.</p><p>However, the AGT competitor maintained her positive attitude by continuing to share videos of herself singing online and on social media channels. When losing one of her close friends in 2021, she was given the opportunity to perform on America’s Got Talent after some producers noticed one of her videos and invited her to audition.</p><p>When asked about her experience with AGT, she revealed:</p><p>“This seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel, the return of the music. It just goes to show that if you’re a local artist, you should put yourself out there. I don’t care if you’re singing while sitting on the restroom floor. Be visible and put your work out there.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Aubrey-Burchell-3-1.jpg alt="Aubrey Burchell" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Aubrey has over 9K Instagram followers, where she routinely publishes her TikTok singing videos, performances, and other updates. Fill The Void, Big White Room, Nothin On Me, Love Murder Misery, Memory, and Fate are among her hits.</p><p>Bay Turner, Camille K., The Nerveless Nocks, Unreal Crew, Mind2Mind, and David Snyder are among the other candidates scheduled to perform on this week’s edition. The audience will be entertained by all four judges on the panel.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurdSbqZ6xXZfCs6%2FHnqOlZZanvK55wKacq6GTlsBus86tZK2ZnJq7tXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-jeannie-mai-go-to-jail.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Jeannie Mai Go To Jail?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophia-loren.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sophia Loren: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
