The film follows a man who must deliver $150,000 in cash to “an alcoholic sister he didn’t know he had” after their father dies. He also becomes involved in the life of her “angry 12-year-old son,” somehow managing to do so without revealing his own identity. Working against the project: This is the kind of title that feels like it’s missing a word no matter how many times you double-check that you’ve got it right.

The duo are hired by Plummer’s “wealthy industrialist” to solve a murder that has gone unsolved for 40 years.

This version focuses more on the huntsman, who is tasked in the fairy tale with taking Snow White into the woods and killing her but ends up letting her go. The huntsman is not a love interest in the film, though the two apparently spend part of the movie chained together during an escape attempt; instead, he is meant to be more like her “mentor.” This film should not be confused with <a href=#>Natalie Portman’s “edgy” Snow White project</a>. Yep, that’s right, there have been two different Snow White projects announced in the past week.
