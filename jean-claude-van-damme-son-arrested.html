Nicholas appears in his dad's 2018 film, while Bianca is also an actress, and opened up about her upbringing, telling : "My parents let us do our own thing. When I was young, my mum pushed me into martial arts for self-discipline. I was seven and like, 'I can't stand it'. I stuck with ballet and [ice] skating. As a teenager, I was so focused on speed skating, I wanted to be in the Olympics." Speaking about her father, she added: "It's complicated. I always have people coming up and telling me how much they love my dad. It's nice to hear, but it's like, what does that have to do with me?"</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
