During an appearance on <a href=#>Friday Night With Jonathan Ross</a> in 2008, he whipped out his feet and confidently discussed his abnormality.</p><p>“I have two toes that are connected, webbed. This made headline news? … They are just a little connected. It is good to tell everyone,” he previously explained. “I heard this one little kid who had webbed toes and he thought he was abnormal but then he saw that I have them too and it confirmed that he is abnormal.”</p><p>The That ‘70s Show alum added, “I thought everyone’s toes were like that.

I had injured it so many times playing football, American football,” he explained. “It’s fine now, but it’s like a gummy bear in there. Like, a little piece of rubber candy.”</p><p>The Fences actor added, “When my kids were young, they would ask me, ‘Daddy, could you show my friends the magic finger?’”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to discover more about what deformities some celebrities have.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axksKGknXq4scirm2aan5nGbrzAq6usZWJlfnR%2BlHJmbGtgbn9w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tori-kelly-is-doing-much-better-after-health-scare-husband-says.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tori Kelly Is Doing Much Better After Health Scare, Husband Says</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rekayla-elastic-strappy-sandal-amazon-7548350.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shoppers Cant Get Enough of These $25 Strappy Sandals That Feel Like a Hug on Your Feet</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
