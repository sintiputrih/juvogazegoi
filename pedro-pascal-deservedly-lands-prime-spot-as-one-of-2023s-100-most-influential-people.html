It isn’t hard to see why when you turn on your screen or head to the cinema and there he is. He is everywhere! The actor’s career has hit the stratosphere in the last few years and he has become one of the most bankable actors working in Hollywood right now.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>It took quite some time and many many cameo roles in television before Pascal eventually made his way into the limelight. The Narcos actor from Santiago, Chile has been on our screens longer than most might think, having appeared in minor roles in shows going back decades such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, NYPD Blue, Law and Order: SVU, and The Good Wife before he made his first breakout appearance in Game of Thrones as Prince Oberyn.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Now it’s hard to read up on entertainment news or turn on your screens and not see him there. The actor has appeared in hit after hit, with each of his performances having been critically and commercially successful. Now, the rise in success has seen him land a prime spot on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Time</a>‘s 100 Most Influential People of 2023 list.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pedro-pascal-joel-the-last-of-us-5.png><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>The article that accompanies Pascal’s place on the list was written by Emmy-award winning actress Sarah Paulson, who started off by stating,</p><p>“Pedro Pascal&nbsp;is the whole motherf-cking deal. Sorry, no other word will do. And I’m not biased, in spite of my knowing for 30 years what you all are&nbsp;just&nbsp;coming to understand&nbsp;about Pedro—I’m not showing off, just simply lucky to have had his phone number my entire adult life. (And no, I won’t give it to you.)”</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Pascal came under the Time’s ‘Icons’ classification rather than the ‘Artist’ one that usually sees actors, filmmakers, and storytellers in general. People in the ‘Artist’ category this year include Colin Farrell, Neil Gaiman, Aubrey Plaza, Rian Johnson, and Michael B. Jordan. In Pascal’s sections, the ‘Icons’ are Salman Rushdie, Imara Jones, Ke Huy Quan, and even King Charles.</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=false>It is rewarding to see Pascal finally get the recognition he deserves, or as Paulson put it, that we are all “just coming to understand about Pedro.” He brings masterful performances to everything he does, even when his face is covered the majority of the time such as in The Mandalorian, or living in a post-apocalyptic fungi-zombie-filled world such as in The Last of Us. He is thoroughly deserving of the title and we congratulate him wholeheartedly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S9prDRqGSpmaOYrq15w56qnqqmmrGtxYylmKeco2K9s7XMnmSsqJ%2BpeqK%2FjKilnmWfm3pzfJFsqmZpYGV6rrvSrWSippahwqa606KYpWWgmryxuMRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./popularmmos-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-429598-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>PopularMMOs Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matthew-berry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Matthew Berry - Bio, Career, Married, Age, Net Worth, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
