The research station is planned to undergo construction near Curaçao, a Dutch island territory located in the Caribbean.</p><p>It’s an ambitious project that reimagines how underwater scientific habitats could be improved. Behar emphasized that the focus of the design was on providing researchers with an environment that prioritizes and maintains their well-being while they are couped up in an isolated space.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288712 alt="Proteus Habitat Design" width=900 height=635 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/proteus-habitat-design.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288712 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Yves Behar/Fuse Project</span><span class=caption-body>The Proteus is meant to accommodate long-term sea expeditions that could last for months.</span></p><p>“The social isolation, the humidity, the lack of light and lack of exercise all needed to be addressed,” Behar said. “I learned about these challenges from Fabien, who had the record as the person who lived longest in an underwater habitat.”</p><p>Indeed, Cousteau is no stranger to undertaking ambitious projects in the name of sea exploration.</p><p>His grandfather Jacques-Yves Cousteau was co-inventor of the aqua-lung apparatus which helps regulate breathing while scuba diving and helped develop one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first underwater habitats</a> known as Conshelf in 1962.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288716 alt="Aquarius Habitat" width=727 height=485 data-sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aquarius-habitat.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288716 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Mark Conlin/VW PICS/UIG/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>The Aquarius (pictured) is the size of a school bus and can only fit about six people.</span></p><p>Fabien Cousteau also participated in a 2014 sea expedition <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mission-31</a>. For 31 days, he shared an underwater living space with a team of five people inside the Aquarius habitat — which is about the size of a school bus — in the Florida Keys.</p><p>By comparison, the Proteus will have about 4,000 square feet of space, roughly the size of a big house. The idea for its all-inclusive design is to accommodate long-term research ocean expeditions — similar to how space missions are carried out.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288715 alt="Fabien Cousteau In Aquarius" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fabien-cousteau-in-aquarius.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288715 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>AP</span><span class=caption-body>Fabien Cousteau, whose grandfather famously built the first underwater habitat, is behind the $135 million project.</span></p><p>“Most of the habitats were purpose-built for one mission or set of missions,” said Cousteau, co-founder of the New York-based non-profit Fabien Cousteau Ocean Learning Center. “They were never conceived as an ‘International Space Station,’ something that’s to be deployed for a longer period of time.”</p><p>The project is estimated to cost $135 million but that may be a small price to pay in advancing our knowledge of the ocean. Our oceans make up about 71 percent of the Earth’s surface, yet the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that humans have only explored about five percent and mapped less than 20 percent of these vast waters.</p><p>“Ocean exploration is 1,000 times more important than space exploration for — selfishly — our survival, for our trajectory into the future,” said Cousteau. “It’s our life support system. It is the very reason why we exist in the first place.”</p><p>Next, checkout <a href=#>how astronauts grew the first flower in space</a> and see the <a href=#>designs for a luxury space hotel — named after a Nazi</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony2usOeqbCZpJq%2Fbr%2FPmpqeZaOprrW1zqdkqaqfqbK2vw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maja-schone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Maja Schne Age, Career, Height, Net Worth, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-do-they-use-dead-horses-for.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What do they use dead horses for?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
