It’s a whopping <span style=font-size:40px>$2 million</span></h3><p><br></p><h2>Johnny Whitaker’s Background</h2><p>John Orson Whitaker, Jr. was born in Van Nuys, California, USA, on December 13, 1959. He is widely known for his various acting roles, including Jody Davis in “Family Affair”, the lead role in “Tom Sawyer”, and Johnny Stuart in “Sigmund And The Sea Monsters”. His career began in 1962.</p><p>Have you ever pondered just how wealthy Johnny Whitaker is? His estimated net worth in late 2017 was over $2 million, according to reliable sources. This wealth stems from his successful career in the film industry.</p><h3>Johnny Whitaker Net Worth: $2 Million</h3><p>Johnny was raised with seven siblings by Thelma and John Orson Whitaker, Sr.; notable among them is his sister, Dora Whitaker, a well-known talent agent. Johnny attended Sylmar High School before spending two years in Portugal doing missionary work for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. After returning, he pursued a degree in Communications from Brigham Young University in 1986.</p><p>Before his professional acting career, Johnny appeared in numerous commercials at the age of three in 1962, and made his adult acting debut as Scotty ‘Scott’ Baldwin on the soap opera “General Hospital” in 1965. This marked the beginning of the increase in his net worth. He proceeded to play Jerry Maxwell in the film “The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!” (1966), and the same year, he took on the role of Jonathan ‘Jody’ Patterson-Davis in the TV series “Family Affair”. This was followed in the next year by his portrayal of Willie Hubbard in the TV series “Gunsmoke”, both of which lasted until 1971, significantly contributing to his net worth.</p><p>In 1972, Johnny appeared in several films, including “Something Evil” where he played Stevie Worden, directed by Steven Spielberg. He also played Napoleon in “Napoleon And Samantha”, and Richard Baxter in “Snowball Express”. He was then selected to play the title role in the film “Tom Sawyer” in 1973, followed by the role of Johnny Stuart in the TV series “Sigmund And The Sea Monsters”. These roles further increased his net worth. However, from 1977 to 2011, he only made three guest-starring appearances, working as a computer analyst for CBS during this period and later for his sister who was a talent agent in Los Angeles.</p><p>In 2011, Johnny appeared as Craig Peterson in the TV film “Growing Up Normal”, and went on to do voice-overs in the 2013 film “A Talking Pony!?!” and the 2014 film “Knock ’em Dead”. More recently, he featured in the role of Mr. Haight in the film “The Wrong Child”, and played Santa in the film “A Husband For Christmas”, both in 2016. These roles also added to his net worth.</p><p>Johnny’s contributions to the entertainment industry were acknowledged when he won the Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award at the Young Artist Awards in 1999.</p><p>As for his personal life, Johnny Whitaker was married to Symbria Wright from 1984 to 1988 and does not have any children. He struggled with substance abuse but successfully overcame it. He decided to become a certified drug counselor and founded the non-profit organization Paso Por Paso, focused on helping addicts through alcohol and drug rehabilitation in Spain.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Johnny Whitaker</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 13, 1959</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Singer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Brigham Young University, Sylmar High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Symbria Wright (m. 1984–1988)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Thelma Whitaker, John O.
