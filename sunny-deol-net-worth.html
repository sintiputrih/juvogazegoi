He made his debut in the film “Betaab” in 1983, which saw him earn a nomination for a Filmfare Best Actor Award. He starred in the film opposite Amrita Singh and the film propelled their career forward, helping their net worth increase. Two years later, he starred in “Arjun” which helped get him established as an action hero. Afterwards, he would continue to star in numerous films throughout the 1980s and 1990s; some of the hits he had during this period included “Dacait”, “Yateem” “Tridev”, and “Vishnu-Devaa”.</p><p>Deol would then star in “Ghayal” which is about a wrongly accused boxer, which became a hit and won seven Filmfare Awards, including a Filmfare Award for Best Actor and a National Film Award for Sammy, which cemented him as one of the better action actors of the time. His net worth would continue to increase at a fast rate.</p><p>He had fewer appearances in 1991, only having success with “Narsimha”. The following year he only had one release, in “Vishwatma”, and would then produce another award winning performance in “Damini – Lightning”, which helped him win several awards including another Filmfare Award and National award. In the mid to late-1990s, he continued to deliver a lot of hit films, including “Darr”, “Jeet”, “Ziddi”, and “Border”. He made his directorial debut with “Dillagi”, which he also produced, plus starred in alongside his brother Bobby.</p><p>In 2001, Sunny starred in “Farz”, portraying a lorry driver who falls in love with a Muslim girl. The film went on to become the biggest hit of the 21st century to date, as the highest grossing Bollywood film at the time; he won a Screen Award for Best Actor and was also given a Filmfare Best Actor nomination. Two years later he would become part of “The Hero: Love Story of a Spy” which featured the first appearance of Priyanka Chopra. The film was dubbed as the most expensive film of the time, but became the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2003. He had another successful release in “Indian”, and would then appear in “Maa Tujnne Salaam”, and in 2010 Sunny was cast in “Right Yaaa Wrong” which had a lot of critical success. The following year, he only had one release in “Yamia Pagla Deewana” which was hit, but has continued making films, and would then try his hand at voice acting with the animated film “Mahabharata”. One of his latest releases is “Ghayal Once Again”.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Sunny is married to Pooja Deol and they have two sons, who have also become a part of the film industry.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=24.399136577708><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Sunny Deol</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 19, 1957</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Sahnewal, India</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.73 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Ramniranjan Anandilal Podar College of Commerce and Economics</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Pooja Deol</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Rajvir Deol, Karan Deol</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Parkash Kaur, Dharmendra</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings</td><td>Bobby Deol, Esha Deol, Ahana Deol, Vijeta Deol, Ajeita Deol</td></tr><tr readability=0.38095238095238><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/sunnydeol</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/iamsunnydeol</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219971/</a></td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Awards</td><td>Filmfare Award for Best Actor, Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor, National Film Award – Special Jury Award / Special Mention (Feature Film), Screen Award for Best Actor, Zee Cine Award for Outstanding Performance - Actor, Main Teri Mohabbat Mei...</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nominations</td><td>Zee Cine Award for Best Actor, IIFA Award for Best Actor, Main Teri Mohabbat Mein (Instrumental), In Mast Nigahon Se, Kabhi Hanste Hai Kabhi Rote Hai (From "Dushmani")</td></tr><tr readability=21><td>Movies</td><td>Main Teri Mohabbat Mein (Instrumental), In Mast Nigahon Se, Kabhi Hanste Hai Kabhi Rote Hai (From "Dushmani"), Ghayal Once Again, Ghayal, Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, Jeet, Ghatak: Lethal, Ziddi, Damini, Border, Singh Saab the Great, Darr, Betaab, Lootere, Yamla Pagla Deewana, The Hero: Love Story of a Spy...</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1.768115942029><tr><th>Title</th><th>Salary</th></tr><tr readability=3.448275862069><td><a href=#>The Hero</a> (2003)</td><td>रू45,000,000 (from percentage of gross)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=91.093538067818><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Nephew of actor , producer Vijay Dhanoya (Dhanoa).
