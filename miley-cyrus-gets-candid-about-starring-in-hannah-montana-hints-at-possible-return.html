The singer specifically mentioned her difficulties in dealing with the show and its end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has almost been ten years since&nbsp;Cyrus&nbsp;starred in the&nbsp;immensely popular Disney Channel show. When asked about her thoughts on the show&nbsp;looking back, the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Plastic Hearts</a>"&nbsp;singer said:</p><p>"The concept of the show is that when you're this character when you have this alter ego, you're valuable. You've got millions of fans, you're the biggest star in the world…..Then the concept was that when I looked like myself when I didn't have the wig on anymore, no one cared about me. I wasn't a star anymore."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus Keeps Drugs In A 'Hannah Montana' CD Case, Cause Nobody's Perfect</a></span></p><p>The hit Disney show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah Montana</a>, had Cyrus playing the character of a girl who was a normal school-going kid in the morning, but a wig-wearing pop star by the evening, trying to balance her double life and keep her secret.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the show ended, Cyrus said she went through an "identity crisis." In her opinion, that happened because she "had gone from being a character almost as often as I was myself."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is The 'Hannah Montana' Role Miley Cyrus Originally Auditioned For</a></span></p><p>Cyrus was just 13 when she was cast for the show, and she played the role of the protagonist until she turned 18. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah Montana</a> also gave way to a film, Hannah Montana: The Movie, in 2009. It featured Cyrus' most popular breakout hits - "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Climb.</a>"</p><p>Soon after the show ended, the singer began releasing independent songs as herself, rather than under the Hannah Montana alias.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She released "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Party in The USA</a>" first, and while the song centering around partying created a little controversy, it was an instant hit. Then came the controversial 2010 release "Can't Be Tamed," which focused on much more adult themes.</p><p>Soon, she had shed her Disney kid image and released the album Bangerz. In this album, she openly talked about using drugs and sex. The album also included the song "Wrecking Ball," the music video for which cemented Cyrus' entrance onto the adult scene - many believe the young woman chose to swing nude on a wrecking ball in the video in order to declare her adulthood to the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Ways Miley Cyrus Has Changed Since Hannah Montana</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I really had to break that," Cyrus said, referring to the kid-friendly persona she had been made to curate as Hannah Montana. "I think that's maybe why I almost created a characterized version of myself at times...I never created a character where it wasn't me, but I was aware of how people saw me, and I may be played into it a little bit."</p><p>Only last year, in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Roman Kemp</a>, the pop star had said that she would be willing to wear the Hannah wig again when the time is right. She said, "Hannah [Montana] is like a fine wine. We gotta wait until she's ready."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Where's Rico From 'Hannah Montana' Today?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqSVrnqkxdGuqmaflanAbq%2FAp5uinF2Wr7DB02aqrZmip7avs4yipWagkaO7orSMpqanrJGjrm60yKerrGWRqXqxu9KsoJuklWK%2FpsDUq6Vo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./olivia-dunne-still-in-disbelief-over-most-viral-tiktok-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Olivia Dunne still in disbelief over most viral TikTok video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-tuck-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-15753-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Tuck Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
