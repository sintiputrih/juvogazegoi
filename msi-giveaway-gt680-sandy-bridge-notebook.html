Good luck!</p><p>Now the rules. This contest is unfortunately only available to US residents in one of the 50 states. I realize that AnandTech is an international site and I do highly value all of our readers, unfortunately extending the contest rules outside of the US is a bit more than we're able to reliably handle today. That's not to say that we won't at some point in the future, we just have little experience doing such things and don't want to get burned early on.</p><p>Secondly, you are only allowed to enter once.</p><p>Third, MSI has 25 free game coupons for Mafia 2. The first 25 people to comment will receive a coupon redeemable for a full copy of the game. Winning this does not exclude you from winning the grand prize. The same rules from below apply for the Mafia 2 coupons and you have to claim your prize within a week of being selected.</p><p>Entries will be accepted from 12:01 AM EST on March 8, 2011 through 12:01 AM EST on April 12, 2011.
