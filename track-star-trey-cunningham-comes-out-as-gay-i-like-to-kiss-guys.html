Especially my latter years of college, I’ve realized people just don’t care.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>He continued, “I’m just Trey and apparently it’s a special thing that I like to kiss guys.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>While Cunningham doesn’t expect much to change in his day-to-day life, he does hope his coming out “helps push the needle forward that it’s OK. This is normal.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Track-Star-Trey-Cunningham-Comes-Out-Apparently-Its-a-Special-Thing-That-I-Like-to-Kiss-Guys-1.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s3>Cunningham — who made the 110m finals at the <a href=#>U.S. Olympic Trials</a> last month, narrowly missing his first Olympic team — began thinking about his sexuality while coming of age in Alabama.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>“In high school, I felt like I was weird,” he said. “I didn’t like people. I wasn’t going after anyone in particular. Toward the end of senior year and then moving to freshman year of college, I was like, ‘Oh, I can explore this side of me.’ It turned out it was more men coming up than women. And now, all men.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>Along the way, Cunningham credited a conversation he had with a track coach at Florida State during his freshman year, which he called “one of the best things that happened to me.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>“We talked about a few things we can do physically,” he recalled. “You can fix your foot, you can do all these things. And the last thing was, ‘I need you to be totally 100 percent comfortable with who you are because there’s no one out there on the track to help you. It’s you in between those two lines and those 10 hurdles. If you’re not comfortable, you can’t really fly.’”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>Cunningham said that heart-to-heart “started this whole journey of me being uncomfortable enough to be comfortable with who I was.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>At the point of that conversation in 2019, Cunningham hadn’t told the majority of the people in his life about his secret. By the end of 2020, he had told his entire family.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>“I don’t think anybody’s surprised,” he joked. “I mean, my favorite Power Ranger was the pink Power Ranger.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Track-Star-Trey-Cunningham-Comes-Out-Apparently-Its-a-Special-Thing-That-I-Like-to-Kiss-Guys-2.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s3>Now, he’s opened himself up to the entire world.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>While Cunningham acknowledged his story might receive some pushback, he’s not really worried about what things look like in the rearview mirror.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>“There’s going to be pockets of places where they don’t tolerate it and they might not champion it, or there might be punishment for it,” Cunningham said. “I think that goes for anything outside of the norm around the world. But for the most part, the students don’t really care as much. They’re just like, ‘OK, cool.’”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKurmZOgerTAwKtkraqVrnqkwc2noKefmJa6bq%2FOppysZZ%2BqwW6t0maemrFdnnqttcqeZK2nXaC2tL%2BMoKyyq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angela-cartwright-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Angela Cartwright Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-brady-girlfriend-is-he-dating-irina-shayk-dating-history-and-relationship-671197-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Brady Girlfriend: Is He Dating Irina Shayk?
