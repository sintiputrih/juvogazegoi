I didn’t want to repeat it.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller</strong></p><p>“Fame is a modern phenomenon caused by the explosion of media, where there’s a zillion digital channels and snappers everywhere.

I stand by everything I do.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller</strong></p><p>“I want it to be known for embracing so many fundamental elements of entertainment: live, competitive, interactive, that ‘sporting’ notion, the reality of getting to know real regular people who have dreams, the soap opera of the judges and contestants, the celebration of music.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I knew I had something special with the Spice Girls because at that time there was a definite feeling of female empowerment, and I felt they could be something important, and so I was already thinking they could be huge all over the world.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“In India, you have mastered music and dance, you produce more musicals than any country in the world and that is the skills I want in Now United.
