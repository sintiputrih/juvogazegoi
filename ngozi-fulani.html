Her professional work provides her with a living. Apart from that, Fulani earns money from her dance career. Ngozi’s net worth is estimated to be $1 million (approx.) as of December 2023.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Fulani overcame several obstacles throughout her life to reach success. According to accounts, she left her family at the age of eighteen and went into a modest apartment. She afterward moved to Hackney. She remembered signing up for Community Studies courses when she was 18 years old. Because they had an African dancing troupe, that day altered her life. It was a watershed moment for her since it cemented her connection to Africa and brought her into touch with Africans living on the continent.</p><p>Ngozi was in one of their rehearsals. Hearing Africans speak with thick accents, learning about the food, and hearing drumming took her to a place she had never visited. She had never felt more liberated than when listening to those beats, and it meant everything to her. She’s been teaching African dance since she was 23. She was a resident teacher in Hackney for twenty years. Because of her talent in African dance, Ngozi led the Emashi Dance group for many years.</p><p>She also taught traditional African dance and culture. They transported young people to Africa every year to learn about their origins and culture. She managed to do all of this while marrying and having children. She also appreciated the chance for her own children to see Africa. She wanted people to witness it for themselves, rather than the conventional pictures of children living in huts, malnourished and with flies in their mouths. That was from a white perspective. She is currently employed as an Independent Sexual Violence Advisor (ISVA) and an Independent Domestic Violence Advisor (IDVA) at Sistah Space. According to LinkedIn, Sistah Space is a safe haven and support network for women and girls of African and Caribbean descent who have experienced sexual or domestic abuse.</p><h2>Ngozi Fulani Husband & Marriage</h2><p><b>Who is Ngozi Fulani’s husband? </b>According to media reports, Ngozi is a married lady.
