The character Kirsty was the daughter of the new managing director of Eden Brothers, the fictional firm that was at the center of the series. Agutter could appear only during the school holidays.</p><p>At this stage of her career, she was listed in credits as Jennifer. In 1966, she portrayed a ballet pupil in Disney’s film Ballerina. In 1968, she was featured in the lavish big-budget 20th Century Fox film musical Star! with Julie Andrews as Gertrude Lawrence. In that motion picture, Agutter played Lawrence’s neglected daughter Pamela.</p><p>Later, she played Roberta in a BBC adaptation of The Railway Children (1968) and played the same part in Lionel Jeffries’s 1970 film of the book. She followed this with a more serious role in the thriller I Start Counting (1969). She also won an Emmy as a supporting actress for her television role as Fritha, which is a British television adaptation of The Snow Goose (1971).</p><p>Agutter moved into adult roles, beginning with Walkabout (1971), playing a teenage schoolgirl lost with her younger brother in the Australian outback. She auditioned for the role in 1967, but funding problems delayed filming until 1969. The delay meant Agutter was 16 at the time of filming, which allowed the director to include nude scenes.</p><p>Among them was a five-minute skinny-dipping scene, which was cut from the original US release. She said at the 2005 Bradford Film Festival at the National Media Museum that she was shocked by the film’s explicitness, but remains on good terms with director Nicolas Roeg.</p><p>Agutter moved to Hollywood at 21 and appeared in a number of films over the next decade, including The Eagle Has Landed (1976), Logan’s Run (1976), Equus (1977), for which she won a BAFTA as Best Supporting Actress), An American Werewolf in London (1981), and an adaptation of the James Herbert novel The Survivor (1981).</p><p>Agutter has commented that the innocence of the characters she played in her early films, combined with the costumes and nudity in later adult roles such as Logan’s Run, Equus, and An American Werewolf in London, is “perfect fantasy fodder”.</p><p>In 1990, Agutter returned to the UK to concentrate on family life and her focus shifted towards British television. During the 1990s, she was cast in an adaptation of Jeffrey Archer’s novel Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less and as the scandalous Idina Hatton in the BBC miniseries The Buccaneers, inspired by Edith Wharton’s unfinished 1938 book and made guest appearances in television series such as Red Dwarf and Heartbeat.</p><p>In 2000, she starred in a third adaptation of The Railway Children, produced by Carlton TV, this time playing the mother. Since then Agutter has had recurring roles in several television series including Spooks, The Invisibles, Monday Monday, and The Alan Clark Diaries. In 2012 Agutter resumed her Hollywood career, appearing as a member of the World Security Council in the blockbuster film The Avengers; she reprised her role in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). She currently plays Sister Julienne in the BBC television drama series Call the Midwife.</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Jenny Agutter</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jenny></span><span>Who is Jenny?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer Ann Agutter OBE is a British actress.
