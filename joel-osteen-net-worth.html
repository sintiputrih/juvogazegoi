He is most well-known for being the pastor at Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. However, his advocacy of the “prosperity gospel” and personal wealth have made him a controversial figure. Criticism has been aimed at his messages, which are seen as too focused on individual enrichment and improvement. Joel’s mega-church is a former sports stadium, with a seating capacity of 17,000 people and covering 600,000 square feet.</p><p>Since 2005, Joel has not taken a salary from his church. His income and wealth come from book advances, royalties, merchandise, and speaking fees.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Joel Scott Osteen was born on March 5, 1963, in Houston, Texas. He is one of six children of John Osteen and Dolores Pilgrim. Osteen attended Humble High School and graduated in 1981. He then went on to study radio and television communications at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but did not graduate.</p><p>Osteen has a half brother from his father’s previous marriage, who also lived with the family when Joel was growing up.</p><h2><span id=Joel_Osteens_Rise_to_Prominence>Joel Osteen’s Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p>Joel Osteen inherited Lakewood Church and its television ministry from his father, John, in 1999. Despite having little formal religious training, he took over his father’s role as pastor and televangelist. In 2003, Lakewood acquired the Compaq Center and spent over $105 million renovating it. The grand opening was attended by 56,000 people and included famous guests like Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Governor of Texas Rick Perry.</p><p>Osteen’s television program grew exponentially and is now viewed in over 100 countries. His weekly sermons are seen by an average of 7 million people per week and 20 million per month. Although he holds no formal degree, he perfected his preaching skills under his father’s guidance and memorizes his speeches before listening back to himself on tape. Osteen’s teachings focus on Biblical principles, with an emphasis on the power of love and a positive attitude.</p><h2><span id=Joel_Osteens_Best-Selling_Books>Joel Osteen’s Best-Selling Books</span></h2><p>Joel Osteen’s first book, “Your Best Life Now,” debuted at the top of the New York Times Best Seller list in 2004 and stayed there for 200 weeks. His second book, “Become A Better You,” sold 4 million copies and reportedly earned him more than $13 million in advances and royalties.</p><p>Osteen has written more than 20 books throughout his career, including his latest works, “Rule Your Day: 6 Keys to Maximizing Your Success and Accelerating Your Dreams” and “Your Greater is Coming: Discover the Path to Your Bigger, Better, and Brighter Future.”</p><p>His books and sermons have allowed him to spread his message of living life to the fullest to sold-out sports arenas around the world. In 2005, Osteen embarked on a 15-city U.S. tour in support of his book and preached to large crowds at each spot.</p><p>John McCain even once described Osteen as his favorite inspirational honor.</p><h2><span id=Joel_Osteens_Personal_Life_and_Beliefs>Joel Osteen’s Personal Life and Beliefs</span></h2><p>Joel Osteen married Victoria IIoff in 1987 and they have two children together. Osteen’s siblings and younger sister are also involved in ministry. He avoids preaching about controversial and political issues but has stated that the church should not neglect other issues. Osteen does not approve of homophobia and supports Israel. In 2011, Osteen and Lakewood Church were sued for copyright infringement by The American Dollar, but a judge ruled in favor of Osteen.</p><h2><span id=Controversy_over_Lakewood_Church_not_opening_as_emergency_shelter_during_Hurricane_Harvey>Controversy over Lakewood Church not opening as emergency shelter during Hurricane Harvey</span></h2><p>In August 2017, Joel Osteen faced criticism for not making Lakewood Church available as an emergency shelter in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. The church, a former basketball arena, stands at 606,000 square feet. Initially, the church stated that the building was unusable due to severe flooding, but Osteen countered the announcement by saying that the church had never closed.</p><p>On the night of August 28th, Lakewood announced they would be open at noon the next day as an available shelter for victims and emergency personnel. A year later, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner proclaimed a day in honor of Osteen and Lakewood Church’s assistance in rebuilding efforts around the city.</p><p>The mayor stated that Lakewood Church provided assistance to more than 1,150 Houston families and donated $1.1 million for rebuilding materials, as well as putting up 2,500 volunteers from their congregation.</p><h2><span id=Joel_Osteens_Income_Sources_and_Beliefs_on_Wealth>Joel Osteen’s Income Sources and Beliefs on Wealth</span></h2><p>Joel Osteen reportedly earns over $70 million per year from his book sales, radio show, public speaking fees, and church collection. Despite his exceptional income, he believes that individuals should not feel guilty for possessing material wealth. Instead, he encourages people to thank and praise God for their acquired wealth. Osteen claims that he takes no salary from the church and relies solely on book sales for his income.</p><h2><span id=Joel_Osteens_Mansion_and_Properties>Joel Osteen’s Mansion and Properties</span></h2><p>Joel Osteen and his wife Victoria Osteen reside in a 17,000 square-foot mansion in the suburbs of Houston. The couple bought the mansion for $10.5 million in 2010, which is now estimated to be worth between $14 and $16 million according to Zillow. Additionally, the couple still owns another Houston home that is worth an estimated $3 million.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC2zp6jZqejqbKmuoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./manhattan-new-york-temple.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Manhattan New York Temple - Church News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./has-jon-jones-ever-lost.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Has Jon Jones ever lost?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-oneplus-6-review.html>Among The Best Of 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrities-speak-out-about-plastic-surgery-before-after-pics.html>Celebrities Speak Out About Plastic Surgery: Before, After Pics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jana-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Jana Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./no-gree-for-anybody-slang-message-rebellion-nigerian-police-claim.html>No gree for anybody slang could be message of rebellion, Nigerian police claim | Nigeria</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skinny-sister-chicken-parmesan.html>Skinny Sister Chicken Parmesan Modern Honey</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVib.
